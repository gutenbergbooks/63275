<p class="p2 unindent hanging"><abbr title="Section One">§ I.</abbr>&mdash;<span class="sc">How the Dabistan first became known&mdash;its
author&mdash;the sources of his information.</span></p>

<p class="p2">It is generally known that sir William Jones was
the first who drew the attention of Orientalists to
the Dabistán. This happened five years after the
beginning of a new era in Oriental literature, the
foundation of the Asiatic Society of Calcutta by that
illustrious man. It may not appear inopportune
here to revive the grateful remembrance of one who
acquired the uncontested merit of not only exciting
in Asia and Europe a new ardor for Oriental studies,
but also of directing them to their great objects&mdash;<span class="muchsmaller">MAN</span>
and <span class="muchsmaller">NATURE</span>; and of endeavoring, by
word and deed, to render the attainment of languages
conducive to the required knowledge equally
easy and attractive.</p>

<p><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv"></a><span class="pageno">iv</span>
Having, very early in life, gained an European
reputation as a scholar and elegant writer, sir William
Jones embarked<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1" id="fnanchor_1"></a><a href="#footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span> for the Indian shores with
vast projects, embracing, with the extension of science,
the general improvement of mankind.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_2" id="fnanchor_2"></a><a href="#footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span> Four
months after his arrival in Calcutta,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_3" id="fnanchor_3"></a><a href="#footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></span> he addressed
as the first president of the Asiatic Society, a small
but select assembly, in which he found minds
responsive to his own noble sentiments. A rapid
sketch of the first labors of their incomparable
leader, may not be irrelevant to our immediate
subject.</p>

<p>In his second anniversary discourse,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_4" id="fnanchor_4"></a><a href="#footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></span> he proposed
a general plan for investigating Asiatic learning,
history, and institutions. In his third discourse, he
traced the line of investigation, which he faithfully
followed, as long as he lived in India, in his annual
public speeches: he determined to exhibit the prominent
features of the five principal nations of Asia&mdash;the
Indians, Arabs, Tartars, Persians, and Chinese.
After having treated in the two following
years of the Arabs and Tartars, he considered in his
sixth discourse<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_5" id="fnanchor_5"></a><a href="#footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></span> the Persians, and declared that he
<a name="Page_v" id="Page_v"></a><span class="pageno">v</span>
had been induced by his earliest investigations to
believe, and by his latest to conclude, that three
primitive races of men must have migrated originally
from a central country, and that this country
was <span class="place">Iran</span>, commonly called Persia. Examining with
particular care the traces of the most ancient languages
and religions which had prevailed in this
country, he rejoiced at “a fortunate discovery, for
which,” he said, “he was first indebted to Mir
Muhammed Hussain, one of the most intelligent
Muselmans in India, and which has at once dissipated
the cloud, and cast a gleam of light on the
primeval history of Iran and of the human race,
of which he had long despaired, and which could
hardly have dawned from any other quarter;”
this was, he declared, “the rare and interesting
tract on twelve different religions, entitled the
<span class="sc">Dabistan</span>.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_6" id="fnanchor_6"></a><a href="#footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir William Jones read the Dabistán for the first
time in 1787. I cannot refrain from subjoining here
the opinion upon this work, which he communicated
in a private letter, dated June, 1787, to J. Shore,
<abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> (afterwards lord Teignmouth); he says: “The
greatest part of it would be very interesting to a
curious reader, but some of it cannot be translated.
It contains more recondite learning, more entertaining
<a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi"></a><span class="pageno">vi</span>
history, more beautiful specimens of poetry,
more ingenuity and wit, more indecency and blasphemy,
than I ever saw collected in a single volume;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_7" id="fnanchor_7"></a><a href="#footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></span>
the two last are not of the author’s, but
are introduced in the chapters on the heretics and
infidels of India.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_8" id="fnanchor_8"></a><a href="#footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></span> On the whole, it is the most
amusing and instructive book I ever read in Persian.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_9" id="fnanchor_9"></a><a href="#footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>We may suppose it was upon the recommendation
of sir William Jones, that Francis Gladwin, one of
the most distinguished members of the new Society,
translated the first chapter of <span class="title">The Dabistán</span>, or
“School of Manners,” which title has been preserved
from due regard to the meritorious Orientalist, who
first published the translation of a part of this work.
The whole of it was printed in the year 1809, in
Calcutta, and translations of some parts of it were
published in <cite>The Asiatic Researches</cite>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_10" id="fnanchor_10"></a><a href="#footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></span>
It is only at
present, more than half a century after the first
public notice of it by sir W. Jones, that the version
<a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii"></a><span class="pageno">vii</span>
of the whole work appears, under the auspices and
at the expense of the Oriental Translation Committee
of Great Britain and Ireland.</p>

<p>Who was the author of the Dabistán?&mdash;Sir William
Jones thought it was composed by a Muhammedan
traveller, a native of Kachmir, named <span class="person">Mohsan</span>,
but distinguished by the assumed surname of
<span class="title">Fání</span>, “the Perishable.”</p>

<p>Gladwin<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_11" id="fnanchor_11"></a><a href="#footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></span>
calls him <span class="title">Shaikh Muhammed Mohsin</span>, and
says that, besides the Dabistán, he has left behind
him a collection of poems, among which there is a
moral essay, entitled <span class="title">Masdur ul asas</span>, “the source of
signs;” he was of the philosophic sect of Súfis,
and patronised by the imperial prince <span class="person">Dara Shikoh</span>,
whom he survived; among his disciples in philosophy
is reckoned <span class="person">Muhammed Tahir</span>, surnamed <span class="title">Ghawri</span>,
whose poems are much admired in Hindostan.
Mohsan’s death is placed in the year of the Hejira
1081 (A. D. 1670).</p>

<p>William Erskine,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_12" id="fnanchor_12"></a><a href="#footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></span>
in search of the true author of
the Dabistán, discovered no other account of Mohsan
Fání than that contained in the <span class="title">Gul-i-Râana</span>, “charming
rose,” of <span class="person">Lachmi Narayán</span>, who flourished in
Hyderabad about the end of the 18th or the beginning
of the 19th century. This author informs us,
under the article of Mohsan Fání, that “Mohsán, a
<a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii"></a><span class="pageno">viii</span>
native of Kachmir, was a learned man and a
respectable poet; a scholar of <span class="person">Mulla Yakub</span>, Súfi of
Kachmir; and that, after completing his studies,
he repaired to Delhi, to the court of the emperor
<span class="person">Shah Jehan</span>, by whom, in consequence of his great
reputation and high acquirements, he was appointed
<span class="title">Sadder</span>, ‘chief judge,’ of Allahabad; that
there he became a disciple of Shaikh <span class="person">Mohib ulla</span>,
an eminent doctor of that city, who wrote the
treatise entitled <span class="title">Teswich</span>, ‘the golden Mean.’
Mohsan Fání enjoyed this honorable office till
Shah Jehân subdued Balkh; at which time <span class="person">Nazer
Muhammed Khan</span>, the Wali, ‘prince,’ of Balkh,
having effected his escape, all his property was
plundered. It happened that in his library there
was found a copy of Mohsan’s Diwán, or ‘poetical
Collection,’ which contained an ode in praise
of the (fugitive) Wáli. This gave such offence
to the emperor, that the Sadder was disgraced and
lost his office, but was generously allowed a pension.
He retired (as Lachmi informs us) to his
native country, where he passed the rest of his
days without any public employment, happy and
respected. His house was frequented by the
most distinguished men of Kachmir, and among
the rest by the governors of the province. He
had lectures at his house, being accustomed to
read to his audience the writings of certain authors
<a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix"></a><span class="pageno">ix</span>
of eminence, on which he delivered moral and
philosophical comments. Several scholars of note,
among whom were Taher Ghawri (before mentioned)
and <span class="person">Haji Aslem Salem</span>, issued from his
school.” He died on the before mentioned date.
“It is to be observed that Lachmi does not mention
the Dabistán as a production of Mohsan Fání,
though, had he written it, it must have been his
most remarkable work.”</p>

<p>Erskine goes on to recapitulate some particulars
mentioned in the Dabistán of the author’s life, and
concludes that it seems very improbable that Mohsan
Fání and the author of the Dabistán were the same
person. In this conclusion, and upon the same
grounds, he coincides with the learned Vans Kennedy.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_13" id="fnanchor_13"></a><a href="#footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>Erskine further quotes,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_14" id="fnanchor_14"></a><a href="#footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></span>
from a manuscript copy
of the Dabistán which he saw in the possession of
Mulla Firuz, in Bombay, the following marginal note
annexed to the close of chapter <abbr title="Fourteen">XIV.</abbr>: “In the city
of Daurse, a king of the Parsis, of the race of the
imperial Anushirván, the Shet Dawer Huryár,
conversed with <span class="person">Amír Zulfikar Ali-al-Husaini</span> (on
whom be the grace of God!), whose poetical
name was Mobed Shah.” This Zulfikar Ali, whoever
he was, the Mulla supposes to be the author of
<a name="Page_x" id="Page_x"></a><span class="pageno">x</span>
the Dabistán. Erskine judiciously subjoins: “On so
slight an authority, I would not willingly set up an
unknown author as the compiler of that work; but
it is to be remarked that many verses of Mobed’s
are quoted in the Dabistán, and there is certainly
reason to suspect that the poetical Mobed, whoever
he may be, was the author of that compilation.”</p>

<p>“To this let it be added, that the author of the
Dabistán; in his account of Mobed Serosh, says<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_15" id="fnanchor_15"></a><a href="#footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></span>
that one Muhammed Mohsan, a man of learning,
told him that he had heard Mobed Serosh give
three hundred and sixty proofs of the existence
of God. This at least makes Muhammed Mohsan,
whoever he may be, a different person from the
author of the Dabistán.”</p>

<p>I cannot omit adding the following notice annexed
to the note quoted above: “Between the printed
copy and Mulla Firuz’s manuscript before alluded
to, a difference occurs in the very beginning of
the work. After the poetical address to the
Deity and the praise of the prophet, with which
the Dabistán, like most other Muselman works,
commences, the manuscript reads: ‘Mohsan Fani
says,’ and two moral couplets succeed. In the
printed copy, the words ‘Mohsan Fani says,’&mdash;which
<a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi"></a><span class="pageno">xi</span>
should occur between the last word of the
first page and the first word of the second&mdash;are
omitted. As no account of the author is given
in the beginning of the book, as is usual with
Muselman writers, Mulla Firuz conjectures that a
careless or ignorant reader may have considered
the words ‘Mohsan Fáni says’ as forming the
commencement of the volume, and as containing
the name of the author of the whole book; whereas
they merely indicate the author of the couplets
that follow, and would rather show that Mohsan
Fani was not the writer of the Dabistán. This
conjecture, I confess, appears to me at once
extremely ingenious and very probable. A comparison
of different manuscripts might throw
more light on the question.”</p>

<p>Concerning the opinion last stated, I can but remark,
that in a manuscript copy of the Dabistán,
which I procured from the library of the king of
Oude, and caused to be transcribed for me, the very
same words: “Mohsan Fani says,” occur (as I have
observed in <abbr title="volume one page">vol. I. p.</abbr> 6, note 3), preceding a <dfn>rabaâ</dfn>,
or quatrain, which begins:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“The world is a book full of knowledge and of justice,” etc. etc.</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>These lines seem well chosen as an introduction
to the text itself, which begins by a summary of the
whole work, exhibiting the titles of the twelve chapters
of which it is composed. As the two copies
<a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii"></a><span class="pageno">xii</span>
mentioned (the one found in Bombay, the other in
Lucknow) contain the same words, they can hardly
be taken for an accidental addition of a copyist. I
found no remark upon this point in Mr. Shea’s
translation, who had two manuscript copies to refer
to. Whatever it be, it must still remain undecided,
whether Mohsan Fani was there named only
as the author of the next quatrain or of the whole
book, although either hypothesis may not appear
destitute of probability; nor can it be considered
strange to admit that the name of Mohsan Fani was
borne by more than one individual. I shall be permitted
to continue calling the author of the Dabistán
by the presumed name of Mohsan Fani.</p>

<p>Dropping this point, we shall now search for
information upon his person, character, and knowledge
in the work itself. Is he really a native of
Kachmir, as here before stated?</p>

<p>Although in the course of his book he makes frequent
mention of Kachmir, he never owns himself
a native of that country. In one part of his narrative,
he expressly alludes to another home. He
begins the second chapter upon the religion of the
Hindus (<abbr title="volume two page">vol. II. p.</abbr> 2) by these words: “As inconstant
fortune had torn away the author from the
shores of Persia, and made him the associate of
the believers in transmigration and those who
addressed their prayers to idols and images, and
<a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii"></a><span class="pageno">xiii</span>
worshipped demons * * * *.” Now we know that
Kachmir is considered as a very ancient seat, nay
as the very cradle, of the doctrine of transmigration,
and of Hinduism in general, with all its tenets, rites,
and customs; and that from the remotest times
to the present it was inhabited by numerous adherents
of this faith; how could the author, if a native
of Kachmir, accuse inconstant fortune for having
made him elsewhere an associate of these very religionists
with whom, from his birth, he must have
been accustomed to live? The passage just quoted
leaves scarce a doubt that the shores of Persia, from
which he bewails having been torn, were really his
native country.</p>

<p class="p2">When was he born?</p>

<p>He no where adduces the date of his birth; the
earliest period of his life which he mentions, is the
year of the Hejira 1028 (A. D. 1618):<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_16" id="fnanchor_16"></a><a href="#footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></span>
in this year
the Mobed Hushíar brought the author to Balik
Nátha, a great adept in the Yoga, or ascetic devotion,
to receive the blessing of that holy man, who pronounced
these words over him: “This boy shall
acquire the knowledge of God.” It is not stated in
what place this happened. The next earliest date
is five years later, 1033 of the Hejira (A. D. 1623).<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_17" id="fnanchor_17"></a><a href="#footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></span>
<a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv"></a><span class="pageno">xiv</span>
He says that, in his infancy, he came with his friends
and relations from Patna to the capital Akbar-abad,
and was carried in the arms of the Mobed Hushíar
to Chatur Vapah, a famous ascetic of those days.
The pious man rejoiced at it, and bestowed his blessing
on the future writer of the Dabistán; he taught
him the <dfn>mantra</dfn>, “prayer,” of the sun, and appointed
one of his disciples to remain with the boy until the
age of manhood. We have here a positive statement:
in the year 1623 A. D., he was “in his
infancy,” and carried “in the arms of his protector.”
Giving the widest extension to these
expressions, we can hardly think him to have been
either much older or younger than seven or eight
years: not much older, for being in some way carried
in the arms of the Mobed; nor much younger,
having been taught a hymn to the sun, and he might
have been a boy of three years when he received the
first-mentioned blessing from Balik Natha. We
may therefore suppose him to have been born about
the year 1615 of our era, in the tenth year of the
reign of the emperor Jehangir. We collect in his
work fifty-three dates relative to himself between
the year 1618 and 1653. From 1627 to 1643, we
see him mostly in Kachmir and Lahore, travelling
between these two places; in 1643, he was at
the holy sepulchre, probably at Meshhad, which
appears to be the furthermost town to the West
<a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv"></a><span class="pageno">xv</span>
which he reached; from 1634 to 1649, he dwelt in
several towns of the Panjab and Guzerat; the next
year he proceeded to Sikakul, the remotest town in
the East which he says he has visited; there he fell
sick, and sojourned during 1653, at which epoch, if
the year of his birth be correctly inferred, he had
attained his thirty-eighth year. We have no other
date of his death than that before stated: if he died
in 1670, it was in the eleventh year of the reign of
Aurengzéb, or Alemgir. Mohsan Fani would therefore
have passed his infancy, youth, and manhood
mostly in India, under the reigns of the three emperors,
Jehangír, Shah Jehan, and Aurengzeb.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_18" id="fnanchor_18"></a><a href="#footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></span> It
was the state of religion, prevailing in those days in
Hindostan that he describes.</p>

<p>From his earliest age he appears to have led an
active life, frequently changing his residence. Such
a mode of life belongs to a travelling merchant or
philosopher, and in our author both qualities might
have been united, as is often the case in Asia. Mohsan
Fani, during his travels, collected the diversified
and curious materials for the Dabistán; he observed
with his own eyes the manners and customs of different
nations and sects. He says himself at the
conclusion of his work: “After having much frequented
the meetings of the followers of the five
<a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi"></a><span class="pageno">xvi</span>
before-said religions,” Magians, Hindus, Jews,
Nazareans, and Muselmans, “the author wished
and undertook to write this book; and whatever
in this work, treating of the religions of different
countries, is stated concerning the creed
of different sects, has been taken from their
books, and for the account of the persons belonging
to any particular sect, the author’s information
was imparted to him by their adherents and
sincere friends, and recorded literally, so that no
trace of partiality nor aversion might be perceived:
in short, the writer of these pages performed no
more than the task of a translator.” This declaration,
even to a severe critic, may appear satisfactory.
Sir William Jones called him<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_19" id="fnanchor_19"></a><a href="#footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></span> a learned and
accurate, a candid and ingenious author. A further
appreciation of Mohsan Fani’s character is
reserved for subsequent pages. We can, however,
here state, that he sought the best means of information,
and gives us what he had acquired not only
from personal experience, which is always more or
less confined; not only from oral instruction, which
is too often imperfectly given and received; but also
from an attentive perusal of the best works which
he could procure upon the subject of his investigation.
Of the latter authorities which the author
produces, some are known in Europe, and we may
<a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii"></a><span class="pageno">xvii</span>
judge of the degree of accuracy and intelligence with
which he has made use of them. Of others, nothing
at all, or merely the name, is known. This is
generally the case with works relative to the old
Persian religion, which is the subject of the first
chapter, divided into fifteen sections.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p class="center"><abbr title="Section Two">§ II.</abbr>&mdash;<span class="sc">Discussion on the Desatir.</span></p>

<p class="p2">This word was considered to be the Arabic plural
of the original Persian word <dfn>dostúr</dfn>, signifying “a
note-book, pillar, canon, model, learned man;”
but, according to the Persian grammar, its plural
would be <dfn>dosturán</dfn>, or <dfn>dostúrha</dfn>, and not <dfn>desátir</dfn>.
From this Arabic form of the word an inference was
drawn against the originality and antiquity of the
Desátir; but this of itself is not sufficient, as will
be shown.</p>

<p>Other readings of the title are <span class="title">Dastánir</span>, in one
passage,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_20" id="fnanchor_20"></a><a href="#footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></span>
and <span class="title">Wasátir</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_21" id="fnanchor_21"></a><a href="#footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></span>
in two other places of Gladwin’s
Persian text, and the last also in a passage of
the printed edition.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_22" id="fnanchor_22"></a><a href="#footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></span> The first is not easily accounted
<a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx"></a><span class="pageno">xx</span>
for, and is probably erroneous; but the second is
found in the index of the printed edition,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_23" id="fnanchor_23"></a><a href="#footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></span> under the
letter <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">و</span>, <dfn>vau</dfn>, and explained: “the name of the book
of Mahabad;” it cannot therefore be taken for a
typographical error, and is the correct title of the
book, as I now think, although I formerly<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_24" id="fnanchor_24"></a><a href="#footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></span> preferred
reading <span class="title">Desátir</span>. It is derivable from the
Sansrcit root <span lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">वाश्</span> <dfn>wás</dfn>, “to sound, to call,” and
therefore in the form of <dfn>wasátis</dfn> or <dfn>wasâtir</dfn> (the <dfn>r</dfn> and
<dfn>s</dfn> being frequently substituted for the <dfn>visarga</dfn>) it signifies
“speech, oracle, precept, command.” It is
also in connection with the old Persian word <dfn>wakshur</dfn>,
“a prophet.” Considering the frequent substitution
in kindred languages of <dfn>ba</dfn> for <dfn>va</dfn>, and <dfn>ba</dfn>
for <dfn>bha</dfn>, it may also be referred to the root <span lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">भाष</span> <dfn>bhasha</dfn>,
“to speak,”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_25" id="fnanchor_25"></a><a href="#footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></span> which, with the prepositions <dfn>pari</dfn>
and <dfn>sam</dfn>, signifies “to explain, expound, discourse.”
Hence we read in the Commentary of the <span class="title">Desátir</span>
the ancient Persian word <dfn>basátir</dfn><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_26" id="fnanchor_26"></a><a href="#footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></span> (not to be found in
modern Persian vocabularies), which is there interpreted
by “speculations,” in the following passage:
<a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi"></a><span class="pageno">xxi</span>
“the speculations (basátir) which I have written on
the <span class="title">desátir</span>.”</p>

<p>I shall nevertheless keep, in the ensuing Dissertation,
the title Desátir, because it is generally
adopted. Besides, in the Mahabádian text, the <dfn>vau</dfn>,
<span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">و</span>, frequently occurs for the Persian <dfn>dál</dfn>, <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">د</span>, thus
we find <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">وادن</span>, <dfn>wáden</dfn>, for <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">دادن</span>, <dfn>dáden</dfn>, “to give;”
and <dfn>wárem</dfn>, <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">وارم</span>, for <dfn>dárem</dfn>, <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">دارم</span>, “I have;” but
I am aware that the two letters, so similar in their
form, may be easily confounded with each other by
the copyist or printer.</p>

<p>The extract from the Desátir contained in the
Dabistán was thought worthy of the greatest attention
by sir William Jones, as before mentioned; nay,
appeared to him “an unexceptionable authority,”
before a part of the Desátir itself was published in
Bombay, in the year 1818, that is, twenty-four years
after the death of that eminent man.</p>

<p>The author of the Dabistán mentions the Desátir
as a work well known among the Sipasians, that is,
the adherents of the most ancient religion of Persia.
According to his statement, the emperor Akbar
conversed frequently with the fire-adorers of Guzerat;
he also called from Persia a follower of Zerdusht,
named <span class="person">Ardeshir</span>, and invited fire-worshippers
from Kirman to his court, and received their religious
books from that country; we may suppose the
<a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii"></a><span class="pageno">xxii</span>
Desátir was among them. So much is positive,
that it is quoted in the <cite>Sharistan chehar chemen</cite>, a
work composed by a celebrated doctor who lived
under the reigns of the emperors Akbar and Jehangír,
and died A. D. 1624. The compiler of the
Burhani Kati, a Persian Dictionary, to be compared
to the Arabic <dfn>Kamus</dfn>, or “sea of language,” quotes
and explains a great number of obsolete words and
philosophic terms upon the authority of the Desátir:
this evidently proves the great esteem in which this
work was held. Let it be considered that a dictionary
is not destined for the use of a sect merely,
but of the whole nation that speaks the language, and
this is the Persian, considered, even by the Arabs,
as the second language in the world and in paradise.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_27" id="fnanchor_27"></a><a href="#footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>It is to be regretted that Mohsan Fani did not
relate where and how he himself became acquainted
with the Desátir. I see no sufficient ground for the
supposition of Silvestre de Sacy<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_28" id="fnanchor_28"></a><a href="#footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></span> and an anonymous
critic,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_29" id="fnanchor_29"></a><a href="#footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></span> that the author of the Dabistán never
saw the Desátir. So much is certain, that the account
which he gives of the Mahabádian religion
<a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii"></a><span class="pageno">xxiii</span>
coincides in every material point with that which is
contained in that part of the sacred book which was
edited in Bombay by <span class="person">Mulla Firuz Bin-i-Kaus</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_30" id="fnanchor_30"></a><a href="#footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>This editor says in his preface (<abbr title="page six">p. vi</abbr>): “The
Desátir is known to have existed for many years,
and has frequently been referred to by Persian
writers, though, as it was regarded as the sacred
volume of a particular sect, it seems to have been
guarded with that jealous care and that incommunicative
spirit, that have particularly distinguished
the religious sects of the East. We can
only fairly expect, therefore, that the contents
should be known to the followers of the sect.”
Mulla Firuz employs here evidently the term <dfn>sect</dfn>
with respect to the dominant religion of the Muhammedan
conquerors, whose violent and powerful intolerance
reduced the still faithful followers of the
ancient national religion to undergo the fate of a
persecuted sect. But we shall see that the doctrine
of the Desátir is justly entitled to a much higher
pretension than to be that of an obscure sect.</p>

<p>Whatever it be, Mulla Firuz possessed the only
<a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv"></a><span class="pageno">xxiv</span>
manuscript of the work then known in Bombay. It
was purchased at Isfahan by his father Kaus, about
the year 1778, from a bookseller, who sold it under
the title of a Gueber book. Brought to Bombay, it
attracted the particular attention of Mr. Duncan, then
governor of Bombay, to such a degree, that he began
an English translation of the work, which was interrupted
by his return to England. The final completion
of the version was owing to the great encouragement
which sir John Malcolm gave Mulla Firuz in
consequence of the high opinion which sir William
Jones had publicly expressed of the Dabistán, the
author of which drew his account of the ancient
Persian dynasties and religions chiefly from the
Desátir. There is an interval of one hundred and
thirty-three years<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_31" id="fnanchor_31"></a><a href="#footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></span>
between the composition of the
Dabistán and the fortuitous purchase of the manuscript
copy of the Desátir, by Kaus in Isfahan; as it
would be assuming to much to suppose that the latter
is the same from which Mohsan Fani drew his information,
we can but admit that the agreement of both,
in the most material points, affords a confirmation of
each respective text.</p>

<p>The great Orientalist Silvestre de Sacy, on reviewing
the Desátir,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_32" id="fnanchor_32"></a><a href="#footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></span>
says: “We are in a manner
<a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv"></a><span class="pageno">xxv</span>
frightened by the multitude and gravity of
the questions which we shall have to solve, or at
least to discuss; for every thing is here a problem:
What is the age of the book? Who is its author?
Is it the work of several persons; or the divers
parts of which it is composed, are they written by
one and the same author, although attributed to
different individuals, who succeeded each other
at long intervals? The language in which it was
written, was it, at any epoch, that of the inhabitants
of Persia, or of any of the countries comprised
in the empire of Iran? Or is it nothing
but a factitious language, invented to support an
imposture? At what epoch were made the
Persian translation accompanying the original
text, and the commentary joined to this translation?
Who is the author of the one and the
other? Are not this translation and this commentary
themselves pseudonymous and apocryphal
books; or may not the whole be the work of an
impostor of the latter centuries? All these questions
present themselves in a crowd to my mind;
and if some of them appear to be easily answered,
others offer more than common difficulties.”</p>

<p>Well may a person, even with far greater pretensions
than mine can be, hesitate to attempt the
discussion of a subject which <em>frightened</em> the illustrious
Silvestre de Sacy; but as the Desátir is one of the
<a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi"></a><span class="pageno">xxvi</span>
principal sources from which the author of the
Dabistán drew his account of the Persian religion
and its divers sects&mdash;a considerable part of his work&mdash;I
cannot dispense with presenting the subject in
the state in which the discussions hitherto published,
by very respectable critics, have left it. If I venture
to offer a few remarks of my own upon it, it is only
in the hope of provoking further elucidations by
philologers who shall examine the Mahabadian text
itself, and by arguments drawn from its fundamentals
decide the important question&mdash;whether we
shall have one language more or less to count
among the relics of antiquity?</p>

<p>Instead of following the order in which the questions
are stated above, I will begin by that which
appears to me the most important, namely: “the
language in which the Desátir is written, is it
nothing but a factitious language invented to support
an imposture?”</p>

<p>The forgery of a language, so bold an imposture,
renders any other fraud probable; through a false
medium no truth can be expected, nor even sought.
But, in order to guard against the preconception of
a forgery having taken place, a preconception the
existence of which may, with too good a foundation,
be apprehended, I shall first examine, as a general
thesis, whether the invention of a language, by one
individual or by a few individuals, is in itself probable
<a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii"></a><span class="pageno">xxvii</span>
and credible. I shall only adduce those principles
which have received the sanction of great philologers,
among whom it may be sufficient to name
baron William Humboldt, and claim the reader’s
indulgence, if, in endeavoring to be clear, I should
not have sufficiently avoided trite observations.</p>

<p>Tracing languages up to their first origin, it has
been found that they are derived from sounds expressive
of feelings; these are preserved in the roots,
from which, in the progressive development of the
faculty of speech, verbs, nouns, and the whole language,
are formed. In every speech, even in the
most simple one, the individual feeling has a connection
with the common nature of mankind; speech
is not a work of reflection: it is an instinctive creation.
The infallible presence of the word required
on every occasion is certainly not a mere act of
memory; no human memory would be capable of
furnishing it, if man did not possess in himself
instinctively the key, not only for the formation of
words, but also for a continued process of association:
upon this the whole system of human
language is founded. By entering into the very
substance of existing languages, it appears evident
that they are intellectual creations, which do
not at all pass from one individual to others, but
can only emerge from the coexisting self-activity
of all.</p>

 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>As long as the language lives in the mouth of a
nation, the words are a progressive production and
reproduction of the faculty to form words. In this
manner only can we explain, without having recourse
to a supernatural cause, how millions of
men can agree to use the same words for every
object, the same locution for every feeling.</p>

<p>Language in general is the sensible exterior vestment
of thought; it is the product of the intelligence,
and the expression of the character of mankind;
in particular it may be considered as the
exterior manifestation of the genius of nations: their
language is their genius, and their genius is their
language. We see of what use the investigation
of idioms may be in tracing the affinities of nations.
History and geography must be taken as
guides in the researches upon tongues; but these
researches would be futile, if languages were the
irregular product of hazard. No: profound feeling
and immediate clearness of vivid intuition act with
wonderful regularity, and follow an unerring analogy.
<a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix"></a><span class="pageno">xxix</span>
The genesis of languages may be assimilated
to that of works of genius&mdash;I mean, of that creative
faculty which gives rules to an art. Thus is it the
language which dictates the grammar. Moreover,
the utmost perfection of which an idiom is susceptible
is a line like that of beauty, which, once attained,
can never be surpassed. This was the case
with some ancient tongues. Since that time, mankind
appear to have lost a faculty or a talent, inasmuch
as they are no more actuated by that urgency
of keen feeling which was the very principle of the
high perfection of those languages.</p>

<p>Comparative philology, a new science, sprung up
within the last thirty years, but already grown to an
unforeseen perfection, has fixed the principles by
which the affinities of languages may be known,
even among the apparently irregular disparities
which various circumstances and revolutions of the
different nations have created. This would have
been impossible, if there did not exist a fundamental
philosophy of language, however concealed, and a
certain consistency, even in the seemingly most
irregular modification of dialect, for instance, in
that of pronunciation. But, even the permutation
of letters in different and the most rude dialects, has
its rules, and follows, within its own compass, a
spontaneous analogy, such as is indispensable for
the easy and common practice of a society more or
<a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx"></a><span class="pageno">xxx</span>
less numerous. Thus sounds, grammatical forms,
and even graphical signs of language have been subjected
to analysis and comparison; the significant
radical letters have been distinguished from the
merely accidental letters, and a distinction has been
established between what is fundamental, and what
is merely historical and accidental.</p>

<p>From these considerations I conclude:</p>

<p class="unindent hanging">First&mdash;That the forgery of a language is in itself
highly improbable;</p>

<p class="unindent hanging">Secondly&mdash;That, if it had been attempted, comparative
philology is perfectly capable of detecting
it.</p>

<p>Taking a large historical view of this subject, we
cannot suppress the following reflection: The formation
of mighty and civilized states being admitted,
even by our strictest chronologers, to have taken
place at least twenty-five centuries before our era, it
can but appear extraordinary, even after taking in
account violent revolutions, that of so multitudinous
and great existences, only such scanty documents
should have come down to us. But, strange to say,
whenever a testimony has escaped the destruction
of time, instead of being greeted with a benevolent
although discerning curiosity, the unexpected stranger
is approached with mistrustful scrutiny, his voice
is stifled with severe rebukes, his credentials discarded
<a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi"></a><span class="pageno">xxxi</span>
with scorn, and by a predetermined and
stubborn condemnation, resuscitating antiquity is
repelled into the tomb of oblivion.</p>

<p>I am aware that all dialectical arguments which
have been or may be alleged against the probability
of forging a language, would be of no avail
against well-proved facts, that languages have been
forged, and that works, written in them, exist.
We may remember the example adduced by Richardson<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_34" id="fnanchor_34"></a><a href="#footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></span>
of a language, as he said, “sufficiently
original, copious, and regular to impose upon
persons of very extensive learning,” forged by
Psalmanazar. This was the assumed name of a
an individual, whom the eminent Orientalist calls
a Jew, but who, born in 1679, in Languedoc or
in Provence, of Christian parents, received a Christian,
nay theological education, as good as his first
instructors, Franciscans, Jesuits, and Dominicans
could bestow. This extraordinary person threw
himself at a very early age into a career of adventures,
in the course of which, at the age of seventeen
years, he fell upon the wild project of passing for a
native of the island of Formosa, first as one who
had been converted to Christianity, then, as still a
pagan, he let himself be baptized by a Scotch minister,
by whom he was recommended to an English
bishop; the latter, in his pious illusion, promoted
<a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii"></a><span class="pageno">xxxii</span>
at once the interests of the convertor, and the fraud
of the neophyte.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_35" id="fnanchor_35"></a><a href="#footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></span>
This adventurer who was bold
enough, while on the continent, to set about inventing
a new character and language, a grammar,
and a division of the year into twenty months, published
in London, although not twenty years old,
a translation of the catechism into his forged language
of Formosa, and a history of the island with
his own alphabetical writing, which read from right
to left&mdash;a gross fiction the temporary success of
which evinces the then prevailing ignorance in history,
geography, and philology. But pious zeal and
fanaticism had changed a scientific discussion into a
religious quarrel, and for too long a time rendered
vain the objections of a few truly learned and clear-sighted
<a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii"></a><span class="pageno">xxxiii</span>
men; until the impostor, either incapable
of supporting longer his pretensions or urged by
his conscience, avowed the deception, and at last
became a truly learned good and estimable man.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_36" id="fnanchor_36"></a><a href="#footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></span>
We see this example badly supports the cause of
forged languages.</p>

<p>In 1805, M. Rousseau, since consul-general of
France at Aleppo, found in a private library at Baghdad
a dictionary of a language which is designated
by the name of <span class="title">Baláibalan</span>, interpreted “he who
vivifies,” and written in Arabic characters called
<dfn>Neshki</dfn>; it was explained in Arabic, Persian, and
Turkish. The unknown author of the dictionary
composed it for the intelligence of mysterious and
occult sciences, written in that language. The
highly learned Silvestre de Sacy had scarce been
informed of this discovery, when he sought and
found in the Royal Library, at Paris, the same dictionary,
and with his usual diligence and sagacity
published a short but lucid Notice of it.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_37" id="fnanchor_37"></a><a href="#footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></span> What he
said therein was sufficient for giving an idea of the
manner in which this language participates in the
grammatical forms of Arabic, Persian, and Turkish.
<a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv"></a><span class="pageno">xxxiv</span>
Silvestre de Sacy, as well as M. Rousseau, have
left it uncertain whether the language be dead or
living; by whom and at what period it was formed,
and what authors have made use of it. The former
adds, that some works written in Baláibalan are
likely to be found in the hands of the Súfis of Persia.</p>

<p>This language deserves perhaps a further examination.
All that is positive in the just-adduced
statement of the two great Orientalists may be said
of any other language, which is not original but composed,
as for instance the English or the Dutch, of
more than one idiom. We can but admit that, at all
times an association of men for a particular purpose,
a school of art, science, and profession may have,
has, and even must have, a particular phraseology.
Any modification of ancient, or production of new,
ideas, will create a modified or a new language; any
powerful influence of particular circumstances will
produce a similar effect; this is a spontaneous reproduction,
and not the intentional forgery of a language.</p>

<p>Such a forgery, even if it could remain undetected,
which it cannot in our times, would but furnish a
curious proof of human ingenuity, to which no
bounds can be assigned; but the true and sole object
of a language could never be attained by it; because,
never would a great number of independent men
be disposed, nor could they be forced, to adopt the
<a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv"></a><span class="pageno">xxxv</span>
vocabulary, grammar, and locutions of a single man,
and appropriate them to themselves for the perpetual
expression of their inmost mind, and for the
exchange of their mutual feelings and ideas.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_38" id="fnanchor_38"></a><a href="#footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></span> To
effect this, is a miracle ascribed to the Divinity, and
with justice; being the evident result of the Heaven-bestowed
faculty of speech, one of the perpetual
miracles of the world.</p>

<p>Of this a prophet must avail himself who announces
to the world the important intelligence of
a heavenly revelation. The great purpose of his
sacred mission implies the widest possible proclamation
of his doctrine in a language generally intelligible,
which a forged language never can be. If,
as was surmised,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_39" id="fnanchor_39"></a><a href="#footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></span>
the Desátir be set up as a rival
to the Koran, it must have been written in a national
language for a nation; the Persians owned
as theirs the <span class="title">Mahabadian</span> religion, the identical one
which history, although not under the same name,
attributes to them in remote ages, as will result
from an examination of the doctrine itself.</p>

<p>Considering the knowledge required, and the
difficulties to be overcome in forging a language in
<a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi"></a><span class="pageno">xxxvi</span>
such a manner as to impose, even for a time, upon
the credulity of others, we shall conclude that nothing
less than direct proof is requisite for establishing
such a forgery as a real fact. Now, what arguments
have been set forth for declaring the language of the
Desátir to be nothing else than “an artificial idiom
invented to support an imposture?”</p>

<p>Silvestre de Sacy says:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_40" id="fnanchor_40"></a><a href="#footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></span>
“It is difficult indeed,
not to perceive that the multiplied relations which
exist between the <span class="title">Asmáni</span>, ‘heavenly,’ and Persian
languages are the result of a systematic
operation, and not <em>the effect of hazard</em>, nor <em>that of
time, which proceeds with less regularity in the alterations
to which language is subjected</em>.”</p>

<p>I must apologise for here interrupting this celebrated
author, for the purpose of referring to what
nobody better than himself has established as a peremptory
condition of existence for any language, and
what he certainly never meant to deny, but may perhaps
here be supposed to forget&mdash;namely, that a language
is not “the effect of hazard,” and although
“not the result of systematic combination,” yet, as
an instinctive creation, shows surprising regularity,
and that an evident rule predominates in the alterations
which time produces in languages.</p>

<p>Silvestre de Sacy proceeds: “The grammar of
the Mahabadian language is evidently, for the
<a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii"></a><span class="pageno">xxxvii</span>
whole etymological part, and even (which is singularly
striking) in what concerns the anomalous
verbs, traced from (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">calquée sur</i>) the Persian grammar,
and as to the radical words, if there be
many of them the origin of which is unknown,
there is also a great number of them in which
the Persian root, more or less altered, may be
recognised without any effort.”</p>

<p>Erskine examined, without the least communication
with the French critic, the Mahabadian language,
and says:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_41" id="fnanchor_41"></a><a href="#footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></span>
“In its grammar it approaches
very nearly to the modern Persian, as well in the
inflection of the nouns and verbs, as in its syntax.”
Norris<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_42" id="fnanchor_42"></a><a href="#footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></span>
takes the very same view of it.</p>

<p>These highly respectable critics published their
judgment upon the Mahabadian language before the
comparison of several languages with the Sanscrit
and between each other had been made by able
philologers, creators of the new science of comparative
philology. According to the latter, the proofs of
the real affinity of language, that is, the proofs that
two languages belong to the same family, are to be
principally and can be properly deduced, from their
<a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii"></a><span class="pageno">xxxviii</span>
grammatical system. Thus, for instance, the forms
of the Greek and Latin languages are in several
parts nearly identical with the Sanscrit, the first bearing
a greater resemblance in one respect, the latter
in another; the Greek verbs in <dfn>mi</dfn>, the Latin declension
of some nouns appear, to use the expression
of the illustrious author, “traced from each other
(<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">calqués l’un sur l’autre</i>).” These two languages
seem to have divided between them the whole system
of the ancient grammar, which is most perfectly
preserved in the Sanscrit. This language
itself is probably, with the two mentioned, derived
from a more ancient language; we meet in them
three sisters recognised by their striking likeness.
This, although more or less weakened and even
obliterated in some features, remains upon the whole
still perceptible in a long series of their relations:
I mean in all those languages which are distinguished
by the name of <dfn>Indo-germanic</dfn>, to which the Persian
belongs.</p>

<p>But, in deciding upon the affinity of languages,
not only the grammatical forms are to be examined,
but also the system of sounds is to be studied, and
the words must be considered in their roots and derivations.
The three critics mentioned agree that the
language of the Desátir is very similar to the Persian
or Deri, not only in grammar, but also in etymology;
a great number of the verbal and nominal
<a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix"></a><span class="pageno">xxxix</span>
roots are the same in both. This similarity would,
according to comparative philology, lead to the conclusion
that either the one is derived from the other,
or that both proceed from a common parent; but
nothing hitherto here alleged can justify the supposition
of invention, forgery, or fabrication of the so-called
Mahabadian language.</p>

<p>We continue to quote the strictures of Silvestre de
Sacy: “There is however a yet stronger proof of
the systematic operation which produced the
factitious idiom. This proof I derive from the
perfect and constant identity which prevails between
the Persian phraseology and that of the
Mahabadian idiom. The one and the other are,
whenever the translation does not degenerate into
paraphrase or commentary, which frequently
happens, traced from each other (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">calqués l’un sur
l’autre</i>) in such a manner that each phrase, in both,
has always the same number of words, and these
words are always arranged in the same order.
For producing such a result, we must admit two
idioms, the grammar of which should be perfectly
alike, as weil with respect to the etymological
part as to the syntax, and their respective dictionaries
offering precisely the same number of
words, whether nouns, verbs, or particles: which
would suppose two nations, having precisely the
same number of ideas, whether absolute or relative,
<a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl"></a><span class="pageno">xl</span>
and conceiving but the same kind and the
same number of relations.”</p>

<p>If what we have already stated be not unfounded,
the last quoted paragraph, which the author calls
“a yet stronger proof of the systematic operations
which produced the factitious idiom” must be
acknowledged not to have the weight which he
would attribute to it. If the Mahabadian and Persian
be languages related to each other, “a perfect
and constant identity of phraseology between
them both,” if even so great as it is said to be, is
not only possible, but may be fairly expected in the
avowed translation of the Desátir into Persian. Such
identity is most religiously aimed at in versions of a
sacred text. Need I adduce modern examples of
translations which, in point of phraseological conformity
with their original, may vie with the Persian
version of the Mahabadian text? The supposition
that two nations have the same number of ideas,
absolute or relative, is far from being absurd: it is
really the fact with all nations who are upon the
same level of civilisation; but the present question
is of the writings of the same nation, which, possessing
at all times a sort of government and religion
fundamentally the same, might easily count an
obsolete language of its own among the monuments
of its antiquity.</p>

<p>On that account, we cannot see what the former
<a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli"></a><span class="pageno">xli</span>
arguments of the critic gain in strength by the addition:
“that the perfect identity of conception falls
in a very great part upon abstract and metaphysical
ideas, in which such a coincidence is infinitely
more difficult than when the question is only
of objects and relations perceptible to the senses.”&mdash;A
great similarity is remarked in all forms of
thinking. Little chance of being contradicted can
be incurred in saying, that the fundamental ideas
of metaphysics are common to all mankind, and
inherent in human reason. The encyclopedian
contents of the Dabistán, concerning the opinions
of so many nations, would furnish a new proof of
it, were this generally acknowledged fact in need
of any further support.</p>

<p>Silvestre de Sacy acknowledges that the Asmáni
language contains a great number of radical words,
the origin of which is not known. Erskine says:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_43" id="fnanchor_43"></a><a href="#footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></span>
“It is certainly singular that the language in which
the Desátir is written, like that in which the Zend-Avesta
is composed, is no where else to be met
with. It is not derived from the Zend, the Pehlevi,
the Sanscrit, Arabic, Turkish, Persian, or
any other known language.” * * * * * *
The basis of the language, and the great majority
of words in it, belong to no known tongue. It
is a mixture of Persian and Indian words. A
<a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii"></a><span class="pageno">xlii</span>
few Arabic words occur.” Norris<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_44" id="fnanchor_44"></a><a href="#footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></span> also found
that a great part of the language appears to have
little resemblance to any other that was ever spoken.
A judgment, so expressed, might induce an impartial
mind to ascribe originality to at least a part of
the Asmáni language; which would naturally render
the other part less liable to suspicion, inasmuch as
it would have been not less difficult to execute, but
less easy to conceal, a partial than a total forgery.
Nevertheless it so happens that the dissimilarity
from any other, as well as the similarity to one particular
idiom, are both equally turned against the
genuineness of the language in question: where dissimilarity
exists, there is absolute forgery&mdash;where
similarity, an awkward disguise!</p>

<p>Erskine continues: “The Persian system it is
unnecessary to particularise; but it is worthy of
attention that, among the words of Indian origin,
not only are many Sanscrit, which might happen
in a work of a remote age, but several belong to
the colloquial language of Hindustán: this is suspicious,
and seems to mark a much more recent
origin. Many words indeed occur in the Desátir
that are common to the Sanscrit and to the vulgar
Indian languages (the author quotes thirty-four of
them); many others might be pointed out. But
the most remarkable class of words is that which
<a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii"></a><span class="pageno">xliii</span>
belongs to the pure Hindi; such I imagine are the
word <dfn>shet</dfn>, ‘respectable,’ prefixed to the names
of prophets and others (twenty-four are adduced).
Whatever may be thought of the words of Persian
descent, it is not probable that those from the
Hindustaní are of a very remote age; they may
perhaps be regarded as considerably posterior to
the settlement of the Muselmans in India.”</p>

<p>Strongly supported by the opinion of respectable
philologers, I do not hesitate to draw a quite contrary
conclusion from the facts stated by Erskine.
It should be remembered that, in the popular or
vulgar dialects are often found remains of ancient
tongues, namely, roots of words, locutions, nay
rules of grammar which have become obsolete, or
disappeared in the cultivated idioms derived from
the same original language. It was not without
reason that the illustrious William Humboldt recommended
to the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain
and Ireland,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_45" id="fnanchor_45"></a><a href="#footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></span>
to examine, on behalf of general
Oriental philology, the different provincial dialects
of India. Even the gibberish of gypsies is not to
be neglected for that purpose.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_46" id="fnanchor_46"></a><a href="#footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus, if we are not greatly mistaken, the very
<a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv"></a><span class="pageno">xliv</span>
arguments alleged to show that the Mahabadian
language is an invention or forgery, lead rather to
a contrary conclusion. Duly sensible of the great
weight of authority which opposes the result of
my inquiry, I sought an explanation of the severe
judgment passed upon the Desátir, and venture to
surmise that it was occasioned by the certainly extravagant
claim to a heavenly origin and incredible antiquity
which has been attached to this work. Such
pretensions, taken in too serious a light, can but
hurt a fixed, if not religious, belief. Every nation
acknowledges but one heavenly book, and rejects
every other. Hence arises a very natural, and even
respectable pre-conception against all that appears
without the limits traced by religion, or mere early
habit and adopted system. Thus a severe censure
is provoked. To annihilate at once the impertinent
pretension to a divine origin, all that ingenuity can
suggest is brought forward to prove the book to be
a fraudulent forgery; to strip it of the awful dignity
of antiquity, it must by any means be represented
as the work of yesterday. But error is not fraud,
and may be as ancient as mankind itself; because
credulous, a man is not the forger of a document. If
the Mahabadian language is not that primitive idiom
from which the Sanscrit, the Zend, and other languages
are derived, it does not follow that it is “a
mere jargon, fabricated with no great address to
<a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv"></a><span class="pageno">xlv</span>
support a religious or philosophical imposture;”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_47" id="fnanchor_47"></a><a href="#footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></span>
if it was not spoken in Iran long before the establishment
of the Péshdadian monarchy, it does
not follow “that it has at no time belonged to any
tribe or nation on the face of the earth.”</p>

<p>However I may appear inclined in favor of the
Desátir, I shall avoid incurring the blame of unfair
concealment by adding to the names of the great
critics above quoted, adverse to this work, the
great one of William von Schlegel. I must avow
it; the celebrated author declares the Desátir,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_48" id="fnanchor_48"></a><a href="#footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></span> intimately
connected with the Dabistán, to be “a forgery
still more refined (than that of the Brahman who
deceived Wilford),<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_49" id="fnanchor_49"></a><a href="#footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></span>
and written in a pretended
ancient language, but fabricated at pleasure.” As
he, however, presents no arguments of his own, but
only appeals in a note to the articles written by Silvestre
de Sacy and Erskine, there is no occasion here
for a further observation concerning this question.
As to von Schlegel’s opinion upon the Dabistán, I
reserve some remarks upon it for another place.</p>

<p>General arguments, opposed to general objections,
may produce persuasion, but are not sufficient
for establishing the positive truth concerning a subject
<a name="Page_xlvi" id="Page_xlvi"></a><span class="pageno">xlvi</span>
in question. It is necessary to dive into the
Mahabadian language itself for adequate proofs of
its genuineness. I might have justly hesitated to
undertake this task, but found it already most ably
achieved by baron von Hammer,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_50" id="fnanchor_50"></a><a href="#footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></span>
in whom we do
not know which we ought to admire most, his vast
store of Oriental erudition, or the indefatigable activity,
with which he diffuses, in an unceasing series
of useful works, the various information derived not
only from the study of the dead letter in books, but
also from converse with the living spirit of the actual
Eastern world. This sagacious reviewer of the
Desátir, examining its language, finds proofs of its
authenticity in the nature of its structure and the
syllables of its formation, which, when compared to
the modern pure Persian or Derí, have the same relation
to it as the Gothic to the English; the old Persian
and the old Germanic idioms exhibit in the
progress of improvement such a wonderful concordance
and analogy as can by no means be the result
of an ingenious combination, nor that of a lucky
accidental coincidence. Thus, the language of the
Desátir has syllables of declension affixed to pronouns,
which coincide with those of the Gothic
and Low German, but are not recognisable in
the modern form of the Persian pronouns. This is
<a name="Page_xlvii" id="Page_xlvii"></a><span class="pageno">xlvii</span>
also the case with some forms of numerical and
other words. The Mahabadian language contains
also a good number of Germanic radicals which
cannot be attributed to the well-known affinity of
the German and the modern Persian, because they
are no more to be found in the latter, but solely in
the Desátir. This has besides many English, Greek,
and Latin words, a series of which baron von Hammer
exhibits, and&mdash;which ought to be duly noticed&mdash;a
considerable number of Mahabadian words,
belonging also to the languages enumerated, are
sought in vain in any Persian dictionary of our
days! Surely, an accidental coincidence of an invented
factitious language, with Greek, Latin, and
Germanic forms would be by far a greater and more
inexplicable miracle, than the great regularity of
this ancient sacred idiom of Persia, and its conformity
with the modern Deri. It is nevertheless
from the latter that the forgery is chiefly inferred.</p>

<p>Moreover, the acute philologer, analysing the
Mahabadian language by itself, points out its essential
elements and component parts, that is, syllables
of derivation, formation, and inflexion. Thus
he adduces as syllables of derivation certain vowels,
or consonants preceded by certain vowels; he shows
certain recurring terminations to be syllables of
formation for substantives, adjectives, and verbs;
he sets forth particular forms of verbs, and remarkable
<a name="Page_xlviii" id="Page_xlviii"></a><span class="pageno">xlviii</span>
expressions. All this he supports by numerous
examples taken from the text of the Desátir. Such
a process enabled him to rectify in some places the
Persian translation of the Mahabadian text.</p>

<p>I can but repeat that my only object here is to
present the question in the same state that I found
it; and am far from contesting, nay, readily admit,
the possibility of arguments which may lead to a
contrary conclusion. Until such are produced, although
not presuming to decide, I may be permitted
to believe that the language of the Desátir is no
forgery; I may range myself on the side of the
celebrated Orientalist mentioned, who, ten years
after the date of his review of the Desátir (ten years
which, with him, are a luminous path of ever-increasing
knowledge), had not changed his opinion
upon the language of the Desátir, and assigns to it<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_51" id="fnanchor_51"></a><a href="#footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></span>
a place among the Asiatic dialects; according to him,
as it is more nearly related to the new Persian than
to the Zand and the Pehlevi, it may be considered
as a new intermediate ring in the hermetic chain
which connects the Germanic idioms with the old
Asiatic languages; it is perhaps the most ancient
dialect of the Deri,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_52" id="fnanchor_52"></a><a href="#footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></span>
spoken, if not in Fars, yet in
<a name="Page_xlix" id="Page_xlix"></a><span class="pageno">xlix</span>
the north-eastern countries of the Persian empire, to
wit, in Sogd and Bamian. When it ceased to be
spoken, like several other languages of by-gone ages,
the Mahabádian was preserved perhaps in a single
book, or fragment of a book, similar in its solitude
to the Hebrew Bible, or the Persian Zend-Avesta.</p>

<p class="p2">At what epoch was the Desátir written?</p>

<p>The epoch assigned to it, according to different
views, is the sixth<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_53" id="fnanchor_53"></a><a href="#footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></span>
or the seventh<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_54" id="fnanchor_54"></a><a href="#footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></span> century of our
era, even the later time of the Seljucides, who reigned
from A. D. 1037 to 1193. The latter epoch is adopted
as the earliest assignable, by Silvestre de Sacy,
who alleges two reasons for his opinion: the one is
his belief that the new Persian language, in which
the Desátir was translated and commented by the
fabricator of the original or Mahabadian text did
not exist earlier; the second reason refers to some
parts of the contents of the Desátir. I shall touch
upon both these questions.</p>

<p>It is useless to discuss what can never be ascertained,
who the author of the Desátir was. But
this work would be unintelligible without the Persian
translation and commentary. Silvestre de Sacy
<a name="Page_l" id="Page_l"></a><span class="pageno">l</span>
asks: “Are not this translation and this commentary,
themselves pseudonymous and apocryphal
books, and is not the whole, perhaps,
the work of an impostor of the last century?” In
answering this, I shall be guided by the baron
von Hammer, who wrote his review of the Desátir
before he had seen that of the <cite>Journal des Savans</cite>,
but, after having perused the latter, declared that
he had nothing to change in his opinion. Although
the commentator, to whom the honor of being the
inventor of the Mahabadian language is ascribed,
follows in the main the ancient text word for word,
and substitutes commonly a new for the obsolete
form of the term, yet frequent instances occur (some
of which baron von Hammer adduces) which prove
that the interpreter did not clearly understand the
old text, but in place of the true meaning gave his
own arbitrary interpretation. The proper names
even are not always the same. Besides&mdash;and this
is most important&mdash;the doctrines contained in the
Desátir and in the Commentary differ from each
other. In the books of the first Mahabadian kings
we find the fundamental ideas of the Oriental philosophy,
such as it was before its migration from Asia
to Europe; but in the commentary we perceive the
development of the Aristotelian scholastic, such as
it formed itself among the Asiatics, when they had,
by means of translations, become acquainted with the
<a name="Page_li" id="Page_li"></a><span class="pageno">li</span>
Stagirite. We shall revert to this subject hereafter.
Whatever it be&mdash;the discrepancies between the original
text and the interpretation, as they would
certainly have been avoided by the author of both,
prove that they are the works of two different persons,
probably with the interval of a few centuries
between them.</p>

<p>The Persian translator and commentator is said
to be the fifth Sassan, who lived in the time of the
Persian king Khusro-Parviz, a contemporary of the
Roman emperor Heraclius, and died only nine years
before the destruction of the ancient Persian monarchy,
or in the year 643 of our era. It must be
presumed that the five Sassans, the first of whom
was a contemporary of Alexander, 323 years before
Christ, were not held to be immediate successors to
each other, but only in the same line of descent;
otherwise an interval of 946 years, from Alexander
to Parviz, comprehending the reign of thirty-one
Arsacides and twenty-two Sassanian princes, would
be given to no more than five individuals, which
absurdity ought not to be attributed to the commentary
of the Desátir. In general, so common is it
with Asiatics to deal with names of celebrity as if
they were generic names, that it is very frequently
impossible to be positive about the true author of a
work. There appears in the present case nothing
to prevent us from placing the translator and commentator
<a name="Page_lii" id="Page_lii"></a><span class="pageno">lii</span>
of the Desátir (whether a Sassan or not)
in the seventh century of our era.</p>

<p>The translation and commentary of the Desátir
are written in what the best judges consider as
very pure Persian, though ancient, without any
mixture whatever of words of Arabic or Chaldean
origin, and conformable to the grammatical system
of modern Persian. But when was the latter
formed?&mdash;As the opinion upon this epoch involves
that upon the age of the composition itself, I shall
be permitted to take a rather extensive historical
view of this part of the question.</p>

<p>Setting aside the Mahabadian kings mentioned
in the Desátir and Dabistán, we know that Gilshah,
Hoshang, Jamshid (true Persian names) are
proclaimed by all Orientalists as founders of the
Persian empire and builders of renowned cities in
very remote times. This empire comprised in its
vast extent different nations, speaking three principal
languages, the Zand, Pehlevi, and Parsi. Among
these nations were the <span class="title">Persæ</span>, “Persians,” properly
and distinctively so called. We are informed by
Herodotus<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_55" id="fnanchor_55"></a><a href="#footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></span>
that there were different races of Persæ,
of whom he enumerates eleven. Those who inhabited
originally <span class="title">Fars</span>, <span class="title">Farsistan</span>,
<span class="title">Persis</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_56" id="fnanchor_56"></a><a href="#footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></span> a country
<a name="Page_liii" id="Page_liii"></a><span class="pageno">liii</span>
double the extent of England, and gave their name
to the whole empire, certainly spoke their own
idiom, the <span class="title">Parsi</span> or <span class="title">Farsi</span>. A national language may
vary in its forms, but never can be destroyed as
long as any part of the nation exits; can we doubt
that the Persians who, once the masters of Asia,
although afterwards shorn of their power, never
ceased to be independent and formidable, preserved
their language to our days?</p>

<p>We may consider as remains of the oldest Persian
language, the proper and other names of persons,
places and things mentioned by the most ancient
historians; now, a number of such words, which
occur in the Hebrew Bible,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_57" id="fnanchor_57"></a><a href="#footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></span>
in Herodotus, and other
Greek authors, are much better explained from
modern Persian than from Zand and Pehlevi. In
the Armenian language exist words common to the
Persian, none common to the Pehlevi;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_58" id="fnanchor_58"></a><a href="#footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></span> therefore,
in very remote times Persian and not Pehlevi was
the dominant idiom of the Iranian nations with
whom the Armenians were in relation. More positive
information is reserved for posterity, when
the cuneiform inscriptions upon the monumental
<a name="Page_liv" id="Page_liv"></a><span class="pageno">liv</span>
rocks and ruins, to be found in all directions within
the greatest part of Asia, shall be deciphered by
future philologers, not perhaps possessing greater
talent, but better means of information from all-revealing
time than those of our days, who have
already successfully begun the great work&mdash;Grotefend,
Rask, St. Martin, Burnouf, Lassen, etc.</p>

<p>Let us now take a hasty review of a few principal
epochs of the Persian empire, with respect to language,
beginning only from that nearest the time, in
which Persia was seen and described by Herodotus,
Ctesias, and Xenophon, not without reference to the
then existing national historical records. Khosru
(Cyrus) the Persian King, placed by the Occidentals in
the seventh century before our era,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_59" id="fnanchor_59"></a><a href="#footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></span> having wrested
the sceptre from the hands of the Medes, who spoke
Pehlevi, naturally produced the ascendancy of his
national idiom. This did not sink under his immediate
successors, Lohrasp and Gushtasp. Although
under the reign of the latter, who received Zardusht
at his court in the sixth century B. C.,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_60" id="fnanchor_60"></a><a href="#footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></span> the Zand
might have had great currency, yet it certainly
declined after Gushtasp, as his grandson Bahman,
<a name="Page_lv" id="Page_lv"></a><span class="pageno">lv</span>
the son of Isfendiar, favored the cultivation of the
Parsi.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_61" id="fnanchor_61"></a><a href="#footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></span>
This language was perfected in Baktria
(the original name of which country is <span class="title">Bákhter</span>,
“East,” an old Persian word) and in the neighboring
Transoxiana; there the towns <span class="place">Bamian</span>, the
Thebes of the East, and <span class="place">Balkh</span>, built by Lohrasp and
sanctified by Gushtasp’s famous Pyræum, besides
<span class="place">Merv</span> and <span class="place">Bokhára</span>, were great seats of Persian arts
and sciences. The Parsi, thus refined, was dominant
in all the royal residences, which changed according
to seasons and circumstances; it was spoken at the
court of the Second <span class="person">Dara</span> (Darius Codomanus), and
sounds in his own name and that of his daughters
<span class="person">Sitára</span> (Statira), “star,” and <span class="person">Roshana</span> (Roxana), “splendor,”
whom the unfortunate king resigned with
his empire to Alexander.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_62" id="fnanchor_62"></a><a href="#footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></span>
This conqueror, intoxicated
with power, endeavored to exterminate the
Mobeds, the guardians of the national religion and
science; he slew many, but dispersed only the
majority. From the death of Alexander (323 B. C.)
to the reign of Ardeshir Babegan (Artaxerxes), the
founder of the Sassanian dynasty (200 A. D.), a
<a name="Page_lvi" id="Page_lvi"></a><span class="pageno">lvi</span>
period of more than five centuries is almost a blank
in the Persian history; but when the last-mentioned
king, the regenerator of the ancient Iranian monarchy,
wishing to restore its laws and literature,
convoked the Mobeds, he found forty thousand of
them before the gate of the fire-temple of Barpa.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_63" id="fnanchor_63"></a><a href="#footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></span>
Ammianus Marcellinus, in the fourth century of our
era attests, that the title of king was in <span class="title">Deri</span>, “court-language,”
yet the Pehlevi was spoken concurrently
with it during the reigns of the first twelve
Sassanian princes, until it was proscribed by a formal
edict of the thirteenth of them, <span class="title">Bahram gor</span>, in
our fifth century. Nushirvan and Parviz, in the
sixth century, were both celebrated for the protection
which they granted to arts and sciences.
We have on record a school of physic, poetry, rhetoric,
dialectics, and abstract sciences, flourishing
at Gandi sapor, a town in Khorasan: the Persian
must have then been highly cultivated. We are
now in the times of Muhammed; were they not
<em>Persian</em>, those Tales, the charm of which, whether
in the original or in the translation, was such, that
the Arabian legislator, to counteract it, summoned
up the power of his high-sounding heaven-inspired
eloquence, and wrote a part of the Koran against
them? If he himself had not named the Deri as
the purest dialect of the Persian, what other language
<a name="Page_lvii" id="Page_lvii"></a><span class="pageno">lvii</span>
could we believe he admired for its extreme
softness so much as to say, that the Almighty used
it when he wished to address the angels in a tone of
mildness and beneficence, whilst he reserved the
Arabic for command?<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_64" id="fnanchor_64"></a><a href="#footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></span> Such a fact, or such a tradition,
presupposes a refined, and therefore long-spoken
language. After Muhammed’s death, his
fanatic successors attempted to bury under the ruins
of the Persian empire even the memory of its ancient
religion and language&mdash;but they did not succeed:
the sacred fire was saved and preserved beyond
the Oxus; it was rekindled in Baktria, that ancient
hearth of Persian splendor; there poetry and eloquence
revived, but could not raise their voices
until princes of Persian origin became lieutenants
of the Mohammedan khalifs. It was under Nasr,
son of Ahmed the Samanian, in the beginning of our
tenth century, that <span class="sc">Rudigi</span> rose, the first celebrated
new Persian poet, but he found, he did not create
the language, more than Homer created Greek,
Dante Italian, or Spenser English. A great author,
in whom the genius of his nation is concentrated,
does no more than aptly collect into a whole the
idiom which exists every where in parts, and elicit
its pre-existing resources. Thus under his pen the
language can appear to spring up with all its beauties&mdash;as
<a name="Page_lviii" id="Page_lviii"></a><span class="pageno">lviii</span>
Minerva, equipped in armour, sprung forth
from the head of Jupiter.</p>

<p>Such being the historical indications relative to
the Persian language, we cannot participate in the
doubts of Silvestre de Sacy, nor find Erskine<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_65" id="fnanchor_65"></a><a href="#footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></span> just in
disdaining even to make a comment upon the credibility
of the hypothesis “that the Persian language
was completely formed in the age of the latter
Sassanians.” It would be rather a matter of
wonder that the Parsi, related to the most ancient
and most cultivated language in the world, should
not have been much sooner fitted for the harmonious
lays of Ferdusi!&mdash;a matter of wonder indeed, that
the Persians, who taught the Arabs so much of
their religion&mdash;heaven and hell, should have remained
behind them in the refinement of their idiom!&mdash;that
they, who could scoff at the <span class="title">Tazis</span> as eaters
of lizards, should not have possessed, in the seventh
century, a language to contend with that people,
who themselves possessed celebrated poets long
before Muhammed!<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_66" id="fnanchor_66"></a><a href="#footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Page_lix" id="Page_lix"></a><span class="pageno">lix</span>
It is for ever regrettable that overpowering Muhammedism
should have spoiled the original admirable
simplicity of one of the softest languages in the
world, by the intrusion of the sonorous but harsher
words of Arabic, and imposed upon us the heavy
tax of learning two languages for understanding
one; but, as the translation of the Desátir is free
from words of an Arabic or Chaldean origin, should
we not fairly conclude, that it was executed before
the Muhammedan conquest of Persia? So did Norris,
and so Erskine&mdash;I can but think&mdash;would have
done, if his judgment and penetration, usually so
right and acute, had not been prepossessed by the
idea of an imposture, which he had assumed as
proved or self-evident, whilst this was the very point
of contestation. Thus, “the very freedom from
words of foreign growth, which the learned natives
consider as a mark of authenticity, appeared to
him the proof of an artificial and fabricated style.”</p>

<p>If even there are some Arabic words to be found
in the text and the translation of the Desátir, this
affords no fair inference that these works had not
been composed before the Arabs conquered Persia,
because those words might have come from Pehlevi,
in which there is a mixture of Arabic, and there are
also Persian words in the Koran; most naturally,
<a name="Page_lx" id="Page_lx"></a><span class="pageno">lx</span>
as there subsisted from times immemorial relations
between Persia and Arabia.</p>

<p>What I have said will, if I am not mistaken, sufficiently
justify the conclusion, that the Persian idiom
could in the seventh century have attained the regularity
and form of the present Persian, such at
least, as it appears in the Commentary of the Desátir,
not without a very perceptible tincture of obsoleteness.</p>

<p>I need scarce remark that the title <span class="title">asmáni</span>, “heavenly,”
belongs exclusively to the superstitious admiration
with which the Desátir is viewed. Nor are
its fifteen books to be taken for sacred works of so
many prophets who succeeded each other after such
long intervals of time; yet nothing prevents us, as I
hope to show, from believing some parts of them
very ancient. Neither are these of the same antiquity.
Thus, prophecies which are certainly interpolations
made after the events, occur in them, not
otherwise than in the Indian Puránas, the fundamental
parts of which are nevertheless now admitted
to be as ancient as the Vedas themselves.
We find in the two last books of the Desátir are
mentioned: the contest between the Abbasides and
the descendants of Ali; the adoption of Muhammedism
by almost the totality of Iran; inimical
sects, and the power of the Turcomans superseding
that of the Arabs; the latter parts must certainly
<a name="Page_lxi" id="Page_lxi"></a><span class="pageno">lxi</span>
have been composed after the taking of Bagdád
by Hulogu in 1258 of our era. The fifteenth
book of the Desátir is probably apocryphal.</p>

<p>As to the doctrine of the Desátir, Erskine says:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_67" id="fnanchor_67"></a><a href="#footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></span>
“I consider that the whole of the peculiar doctrines,
ascribed to Mahabad and Hoshang, is borrowed
from the mystical doctrines of the Persian
Súfis, and from the ascetic tenets and practices of
the Yogis and Sanyasis, of India who drew many
of their opinions from the Vedanta-school.” But
this involves the great historical question, concerning
the origin of Súfism and the whole Indian philosophy,
which is by some (not without foundation)
believed to have been spread throughout a great part
of Asia. It is quite gratuitous, I may say, to regard
them “as having had no existence before the time
of Azar Kaivan<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_68" id="fnanchor_68"></a><a href="#footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></span> and his disciples in the reigns of
Akbar and Jehanguir, and as having been devised
and reduced into form between 200 and 300
years ago in the school of Sipasi-philosophers.”
Nor can I admit as better founded the following insinuations
of the same ingenious critic: “Nor shall
I inquire whether many of the acute metaphysical
remarks that abound in the commentary and the
general style of argument which it employs have
not rather proceeded from the schoolmen of the
<a name="Page_lxii" id="Page_lxii"></a><span class="pageno">lxii</span>
West, than directly from the Oriental or Aristotelian
philosophy.” To this may be answered:
It is highly problematic, whether the translator of
the Desátir ever knew any schoolman of the West,
but it is certain that he, as an Asiatic and a Persian,
knew the Oriental philosophy, the fundamentals of
which were preserved in the first books of the Desátir,
as we have already said; but the commentator
could but participate in the modification, which the
ancient doctrine had undergone in his age, after
its return from the West to the East, in translations
of Greek philosophical works into Asiatic languages.
Thus, in the Desátir and its commentary&mdash;I borrow
the words of baron von Hammer:&mdash;“We see
already germinating the double seed of reason and
light, from which sprung up the double tree of
rational and ideal philosophy,”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_69" id="fnanchor_69"></a><a href="#footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></span> which spread its
ramifications over the whole world, and lives and
flourishes even in our times.</p>

<p>The commentator was no ordinary man: living,
as we may believe, in the first half of the seventh
century, he possessed the sciences of his learned
age; flourishing under the reign of king Khosru
Parviz, who professed the ancient Persian religion
in his letter to a Roman emperor of the East,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_70" id="fnanchor_70"></a><a href="#footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></span> and
<a name="Page_lxiii" id="Page_lxiii"></a><span class="pageno">lxiii</span>
tore to pieces Muhammed’s written invitation to
adopt Islam<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_71" id="fnanchor_71"></a><a href="#footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></span>; in this yet unshaken state of national
independence, the fifth Sassan preserved pure his
creed and style from the influence of the Arabian
prophet. The translator and commentator of the
Desátir says of himself:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_72" id="fnanchor_72"></a><a href="#footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></span> “I too have written a
celebrated book under the name of <span class="title">Do giti</span>, ‘the
two worlds’, full of admirable wisdom, which
I have derived from the most exalted intelligence,
and in the eminent book of the famous prophet,
the King of Kings, Jemshid, there is a great deal,
concerning the unity which only distinguished
Asceties (<span class="title">Hertasp</span>) can comprehend, and on the
subject of this transcendant knowledge I have
also composed a great volume <cite>Pertú están</cite>, ‘the
mansion of light,’ which I have adorned by
<a name="Page_lxiv" id="Page_lxiv"></a><span class="pageno">lxiv</span>
evidence deduced from reason, and by texts from
the <cite>Desátir</cite> and <cite>Avesta</cite>, so that <em>the soul of every man</em>
may derive pleasure from it. And it is one of the
books of the secrets of the great God.”</p>

<p>This is a most important declaration. The commentator
considered the Desátir and the Avesta as
sources of delight <span class="muchsmaller">TO ALL MEN</span>. And he was right.
The doctrine of the former work now under consideration
is found every where, not denied either
by the ancients or moderns; it is the property of
mankind. As such, “<cite>it does not belong to any particular
tribe or nation</cite>:” in which point, although in quite
another sense, we agree with Erskine, but we may
dissent from the learned author, when he taxes it to
be “a religious or philosophical imposture, which
needed the support of a fabricated language.” After
careful examination, I must conscientiously declare,
I discover no imposture aimed at by any artifice;
there was no secret to be concealed; nothing to be
disguised; the Mahabadian religion is as open as its
temple, the vault of heaven, and as clear as the
lights, flaming in their ethereal attitudes; its book
is a sort of catechism of Asiatic religion; its prayer
a litany of Oriental devotion, in which any man may
join his voice.</p>

<p>Thus have I endeavored, to the best of my
power, to exhibit faithfully what has hitherto been
alleged for and against the authenticity of the book,
<a name="Page_lxv" id="Page_lxv"></a><span class="pageno">lxv</span>
which is one of the principal authorities of the
Dabistán. If the author of this latter work was,
as the often-quoted ingenuous author supposes,
“in strict intimacy with the sects of enthusiasts
by whom the Desátir was venerated, and whose
rule it was,” we may so much the more rely upon
the truth of his account concerning such a religious
association. If he professed the new religion,
which the emperor Akbar had endeavored to
found, as this was a revival of the ancient Persian
religion, we may reasonably presume, that he
would have searched, and brought to light writings
concerning it which were concealed, neglected, or
little known; he would have cautiously scrutinized
the authenticity of the documents, and conscientiously
respected the sacred sources of that faith,
which, after a careful examination of all others,
deserved his preference; nothing justifies the supposition,
that he would forge any thing himself, or
countenance, or not be able to detect, the forgery
of others. However this be, Mohsan Fani’s character
will be best known by the perusal of his work;
after a rapid synopsis of its contents, to which I will
now proceed, I shall be permitted to point out, as
briefly as possible, some of the merits and defects
conspicuous in his composition.</p>

probably to the time of the Macedonian conquest, when he says (<abbr title="15, 2, section 8, folio 724, edition Casaubon">xv. 2,

Khosru Parviz to a Roman emperor, whose name, however, is not mentioned.
During the reign of this Persian king, two emperors ruled in the
East, namely, Mauritius, whose daughter Parviz married, and Heraclius,
by whom he was defeated towards the end of his life. I found it
probable, but had no authority to assert (see <abbr title="volume one page">vol. I. p.</abbr> 145, <a href="#footnote_348">note 2</a>), that
the above-stated profession was made to Mauritius; but those verses by
themselves deserve attention, as they establish the adherence of Parviz to
the religion of Hoshang, in contradiction to several historians, according
to whom he adopted Christianity: this assertion seems founded upon his
great attachment to the celebrated <span class="person">Mary</span>, or <span class="person">Chirín</span>, his Christian wife,
and daughter of a Christian emperor, the said Mauritius.</p>

<p class="p2 unindent hanging"><abbr title="Section One">§ I.</abbr>&mdash;THE FIRST RELIGION&mdash;THE DYNASTIES OF MAHABAD,
ABAD AZAR, SHAI ABAD, SHAI GILIV, SHAI MAHBUL,
AND YASAN.</p>

<p>Mohsan Fani exhibits the remarkable notions,
dogmas, customs, and ceremonies of twelve religions,
and their various sects, without giving more of their
origin and genesis than the names of their founders.
The very first principle of all religion is referred,
by some, to a primitive Divine revelation; by others,
to a natural propensity of the human mind to superstition.
However this may be, history confirms the
suggestions of psychology, that admiration was one
of the principal sources of religious feelings; how
should man not be struck with the glories of the sky?
Therefore, the adoration of stars was one of the
most ancient religions. It needed no prophet: it is
“<em>the poetry of heaven</em>,” imprinted in eternal characters
of fire upon the ethereal expanse. Prometheus,
<a name="Page_lxvii" id="Page_lxvii"></a><span class="pageno">lxvii</span>
enumerating the benefits which he bestowed upon
untutored barbarians, says:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_73" id="fnanchor_73"></a><a href="#footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>According to all traditions, astronomy was one
of the first sciences cultivated by men.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_75" id="fnanchor_75"></a><a href="#footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></span> The stars
not only occasioned the institution, but also served
to announce the regular return, of religious feasts;
thus they became, as called by Plato, “the instruments
of time,” men were at once induced and
taught by religion to count months and years. Astronomy,
in her feast-calendars, consecrated upon
an altar the first fruits of her labors.</p>

<p>Upon the star-paved path of heaven man was
conducted to the sanctuary of the supreme Being.
In general, the first feeling of “the Divine (<span lang="el" xml:lang="el">το θεῖον</span>),”
seizing the human mind with its own supernatural
power, elevated it at once above the material concerns
<a name="Page_lxviii" id="Page_lxviii"></a><span class="pageno">lxviii</span>
of the nether world; thus, sublime ideas of
the Deity, the universe, and the immortality of the
soul preceded the invention of many arts and sciences
relative to the comforts of social life. This is confirmed
by the account, contained in the Dabistán, of
the most ancient religion of the Persians, which is
founded upon transcendental ideas of the Divinity:
“Except God himself, who can comprehend his
origin? Entity, unity, identity are inseparable
properties of this original essence, and are not
adventitious to Him.” So the Desátir, with
which the Dabistán generally so fully agrees, that we
can scarce doubt that the author of the latter had
the former before his eyes.</p>

<p>No sooner has man acquired the consciousness
of mental freedom, than he endeavors to expand
beyond himself the first vague feeling of the Divine;
not satisfied to admire all exterior marvel, he desires
to understand and to name its interior moving
cause: this is something immaterial; it is a soul,
such as acts in himself. Among the ancient Iranians,
the “first creation of the existence-bestowing
bounty” was the intellectual principle, called <dfn>Azad
Bahman</dfn>, “the first intelligence;” he is also the first
angel; from him other spirits or angels proceed.
Every star, every heavenly sphere has its particular
intelligence and spirit or angel. In the lower region,
each of the four elements owns its particular
<a name="Page_lxix" id="Page_lxix"></a><span class="pageno">lxix</span>
guardian; vegetables, minerals, animals have their
protecting angels; the conservative angel of mankind
is <span class="title">Farun Faro Vakshur</span>. It is not without reason,
that this religion was called “the religion of light.”
As the supreme Being</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i2b">“Sow’d with stars the heav’n thick as the field.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_76" id="fnanchor_76"></a><a href="#footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></span></div>
 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p class="unindent">So also he peopled the vast extent with the “sons
of light, the empyreal host of angels,” who not only
moved and governed the celestial orbs, but also
descended into the elemental regions to direct, promote,
and protect his creation. Not a drop of dew
fell without an angel. The Hindus and Greeks animated
universal nature; the Persians imparadized
the whole creation by making it the abode of angels.
Hence demonology in all its extent. But, “<em>among</em>
the most resplendent, powerful, and glorious
of the servants who are free from inferior bodies
and matter, there is none God’s enemy or rival,
or disobedient, or cast down, or annihilated.”
This important passage of the Desátir<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_77" id="fnanchor_77"></a><a href="#footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></span> I shall have
occasion to refer to hereafter.</p>

<p>Human souls are eternal and infinite; they come
from above, and are spirits of the upper spheres.
If distinguished for knowledge and sanctity, while
on earth, they return above, are united with the
sun, and become empyreal sovereigns; but if the
<a name="Page_lxx" id="Page_lxx"></a><span class="pageno">lxx</span>
proportion of their good works bore a closer affinity
to any other star, they become lords of the place
assigned to that star; their stations are in conformity
with the degrees of their virtue; perfect men attain
the beatific vision of the light of lights, and the cherubine
hosts of the supreme Lord. Vice and depravity,
on the contrary, separate souls from the
primitive source of light, and chain them to the
abode of the elements: they become evil spirits. The
imperfectly good migrate from one body to another,
until, by the efficacy of good words and actions,
they are finally emancipated from matter, and gain
a higher rank. The thoroughly-depraved descend
from the human form to animal bodies, to vegetable,
and even to mineral substances.</p>

<p>So far we see the well-known dogma of transmigration
ingeniously combined with the Sidereal
religion. Here is exhibited a singular system of
heavenly dominion, maintained by every star, whether
fixed or planetary, during periods of many
thousand years. A fixed star begins the revolution,
and reigns alone, the king of the cycle, during a
millenium, after which, each of the fixed and planetary
stars becomes its partner or prime-minister
for a thousand years; the last of all is the moon, for
a millenium. Then the sovereignty of the first king
devolves to the star which was its first associate.
This second king goes through the same course as
<a name="Page_lxxi" id="Page_lxxi"></a><span class="pageno">lxxi</span>
the first, until this becomes for a thousand years
his partner, and then his period is also past. The
same is the course of all other stars. When the
moon shall have been king, and all stars associated
with it and its reign too past, then one great period
shall be accomplished. The state of the revolving
world recommences, the human beings, animals,
vegetables, and minerals, which existed during the
first cycle, are restored to their former language,
acts, dispositions, species, and appearances; the
world is renovated, that is to say, forms, similar to
those which passed away, reappear. This system,
copied from the Desátir,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_78" id="fnanchor_78"></a><a href="#footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></span> expresses nothing else but
the general vague idea of long heavenly revolutions,
and periodical renovations of the same order of
things in the nether world.</p>

<p>The Dabistán<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_79" id="fnanchor_79"></a><a href="#footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></span> adds a mode of computing as peculiar
to the followers of the ancient faith: they call
one revolution of the regent Saturn a day; thirty
such days one month; twelve such months one year;
a million of such years one <dfn>fard</dfn>; a million fard one
<dfn>vard</dfn>; a million vard one <dfn>mard</dfn>; a million vard one
<dfn>jad</dfn>; three thousand jads one <dfn>vad</dfn>; and two thousand
vád one <dfn>zád</dfn>. To these I must subjoin <dfn>salam</dfn>, <dfn>shamar</dfn>,
<dfn>aspar</dfn>, <dfn>radah</dfn>, <dfn>aradah</dfn>, <dfn>raz</dfn>, <dfn>araz</dfn>, <dfn>biaraz</dfn>, that is,
<a name="Page_lxxii" id="Page_lxxii"></a><span class="pageno">lxxii</span>
eight members of a geometric progression, the first
of which is 100,000, and the coefficient 100. But
these years are revolutions, called <dfn>farsals</dfn>, of thirty
common years each. There are besides farsals of
Mars, Venus, Mercury, and the moon, a day of each
being the time of their respective revolution.</p>

<p>I thought it necessary to repeat these extravagant
numbers, because it is by them that the reigns of the
first ancient dynasties are measured.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_80" id="fnanchor_80"></a><a href="#footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></span> The first
earthly ruler of the present cycle, who with his wife
survived the great period to become the first ancestor
of a new innumerable population, was <span class="person">Mahabada</span>.
This name seems of Sanscrit derivation.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_81" id="fnanchor_81"></a><a href="#footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></span> In his
reign we find traced the first ground-lines of all
human societies; agriculture and the arts of life are
invented; villages and cities organised; four classes
of society established&mdash;priests, warriors, agriculturists,
and tradesmen. The names of these classes
are in the Dabistán much like those of the four
<a name="Page_lxxiii" id="Page_lxxiii"></a><span class="pageno">lxxiii</span>
Hindu <span class="title">castes</span>, but the Desátir and the Shahnamah
have other denominations, belonging to an ancient
Persian dialect,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_82" id="fnanchor_82"></a><a href="#footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></span> for these divisions, which originated
in the indispensable wants of a rising society.
This institution connects itself with the principles
of social morality: men are bound to each other by
the laws of justice and mutual kindness, which is
extended even to all innoxious creatures. To Mahabad
the <span class="title">Desátir</span> was sent, a celestial code, and his
faith was maintained through the whole series of
his fourteen successors; the number of whom reminds
us of the fourteen Indian Manus; they are
said to have reigned six hundred and six trillions
of years.</p>

<p>To the Mahabadians succeeded <span class="person">Abad Azar</span>, who
soon withdrew from government, and devoted himself
to solitude and piety. After him, the hitherto
fortunate state of society changed into war, confusion,
and anarchy. His son, <span class="person">Jai Afram</span>, was called
to the throne, and restored peace and order in the
world, giving his name to a new dynasty. After
this, four other princely families are named, that of
<span class="person">Shai Abad</span>, <span class="person">Shai Giliv</span>,
<span class="person">Shai Mahbul</span>, and <span class="person">Yasan</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_83" id="fnanchor_83"></a><a href="#footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></span> I
shall not count the many millions of years during
<a name="Page_lxxiv" id="Page_lxxiv"></a><span class="pageno">lxxiv</span>
which they ruled; all that is said of their reigns
appears nothing but a repetition of the first; a
period of peace, order, and happiness is followed
by war, disorder, and misery, until a revolution
renews the state of things. Such traditions of a
progress and regress in virtue and happiness, and
of repeated changes from one condition to another,
are not destitute of general truth. The moral is not,
more than the physical world, exempt from revolutions.
These, although their date cannot be determined,
have left behind them undeniable traces,
and without a reference to them, we could not explain
so much of the strangeness, incoherence, and
heterogeneity in the history of men and nature.</p>

<p>Thus I have slightly sketched the principal features
of the religion which prevailed among the first
Persian dynasties; these, not mentioned in other
historical books, are we know peculiar to the Desátir
and Dabistán, which appeared to sir W. Jones an
unexceptionable authority for believing the Iranian
monarchy “the oldest in the world.” Upon this,
W. Erskine remarked:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_84" id="fnanchor_84"></a><a href="#footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></span> “Shall I be forgiven for
saying, that the history of letters seems to me
scarcely to afford an instance of a more perverted
judgment on historical evidence?” Silvestre de
Sacy<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_85" id="fnanchor_85"></a><a href="#footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></span> too “banishes among the most absurd fables
<a name="Page_lxxv" id="Page_lxxv"></a><span class="pageno">lxxv</span>
the dynasties of the Mahabadians, and of their
successors, which sir William Jones, and after
him some other Orientalists, have too hastily
adopted, and of which they would to-day blush,
since their titles have been produced.” More
recently, William von Schlegel<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_86" id="fnanchor_86"></a><a href="#footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></span> said: “It would
be useless to conceal to the public that that learned
man, endowed with talents so rare, was totally
deficient in historical criticism:” This was inferred,
because he had admitted, and used in
some of his considerations, as genuine, a forgery
of Wilford’s Pandit. Besides, “he received without
diffidence, and even welcomed with enthusiasm,
the traditions contained in the Dabistán, a modern
Persian book, written with <em>the intention to claim
for Persia the pre-eminence over India with respect to
the antiquity of religious revelations</em>.”</p>

<p>As to “the intention” mentioned, I hope to be
able to justify Mohsan Fani. With respect to the
Mahabadian dynasties&mdash;the light recently acquired
upon the ancient history of Persia, reflect rather
favorably upon that part of sir William Jones’s opinion,
that this country, in its wide extent, was once
the original seat of many nations now settled in distant
regions. So much, at least, may be considered
as established: 1. that the limits of history are to
<a name="Page_lxxvi" id="Page_lxxvi"></a><span class="pageno">lxxvi</span>
be removed further back than those before fixed;
2. that in the earliest times primitive nations, related
by language to each other, had their origin in the
common elevated country of central Asia, and that
the Iranians and Indians were once united before
their migration into Iran and India.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_87" id="fnanchor_87"></a><a href="#footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></span> This great
fact presents itself, as it were, upon the border of a
vast abyss of unknown times.</p>

<p>For these a measure was sought. Hence we meet
with extravagant, but perpetually recurring chronological
statements. The Mahabadian ages are neither
better nor worse, as to accuracy, than the Indian
yugs, the Chaldean,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_88" id="fnanchor_88"></a><a href="#footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></span> or other periods. In order to
reduce them to their true value, we must consider
them as nothing else than expressions of the ideas
which the ancients entertained of the antiquity of
the world and human society, in which they cannot
be easily refuted, and at least are not absurd. Such
ideas originated, when man, curious after his past,
had long ceased to be a listless barbarian; but the
earliest civilisation is a late product of slow-working
time, the memory of which could have been preserved
<a name="Page_lxxvii" id="Page_lxxvii"></a><span class="pageno">lxxvii</span>
only by monuments. The most ancient of
these however are but recent in our historical knowledge,
the limits of which are far from being those of
antiquity. The duration of ante-historical empires,
in printless but extensive spaces of times, escapes
research and computation. As men, however, bear
with impatience vague and loose ideas, the Persians,
as well as other nations, determined the past by
numbers formed from the multiplication of some
astronomical periods known in early times, as has
been observed:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_89" id="fnanchor_89"></a><a href="#footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></span> this appears to me at once the
whole truth and falsehood of those statements. In
the utter impossibility to reconcile the discordant
data of different nations, we must content ourselves
to take up the general ideas and facts in which they
all agree, whilst in the particulars they all differ.
Thus, in laying down maps of countries little known,
we are satisfied with tracing the general direction of
some rivers and mountains, and abstain from topographical
details.</p>

 Hyde, who did not know the Dabistán, says (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 188): that a year, or
calendar, of Median invention was introduced in Persia, before Jamshid,
that is, according to Ferdusi’s not irrational chronology, earlier than
3429 before our era.</p>

 It is known that in India, and perhaps all over Asia, the number of
ciphers not followed by a significative number, is indifferent, and indicates
nothing else but magnitude. Thus the Hindus, to determine positively
hundreds, thousands, etc., affix the required figure at the end: for
instance, to determine 100 rupees to be given, they write 101.</p>

 The word is perhaps a form of the Sanscrit <dfn>Mahábodhi</dfn>, “a great
deified teacher.” In the Burhani Kati we find six significations attributed
to the word <dfn>Abad</dfn>; these are: 1. cultivated; 2. praise and prayer;
3. exclamation of praise; 4. the name of the Kaba; 5. the name of the first
Persian prophet; 6. good and beauteous.</p>

who, according to Berosus, Epigenes, Diodorus of Sicily, Abydenus
counted 490,000, 720,000, 473,000, 463,763 years. They are said to
have exhibited, before Alexander’s conquest in Asia, historical annals
for 150,000 years.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p class="p2 unindent hanging"><abbr title="Section Two">§ II.</abbr>&mdash;<span class="sc">The Peshdadian, Kayanian, Ashkanian, and
Sassanian Dynasties&mdash;their religious and political
institutions.</span></p>

<p>After the four dynasties mentioned follows the
<dfn>Gilshanian</dfn>, monarchy, founded by <span class="title">Gilshah</span>, or <span class="title">Kayomers</span>,
<a name="Page_lxxviii" id="Page_lxxviii"></a><span class="pageno">lxxviii</span>
“the king or form of earth.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_90" id="fnanchor_90"></a><a href="#footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></span> We are now
upon well-known ground, and hear familiar names
of four races: the <span class="title">Péshdadian</span>, <span class="title">Kayanian</span>, <span class="title">Ashkaniun</span>,
and <span class="title">Sassanian</span>, to which, altogether, the Dabistán
attributes a period of 6024 years, differing considerably
from that of other Asiatic chronologers.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_91" id="fnanchor_91"></a><a href="#footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir William Jones was right when he declared,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_92" id="fnanchor_92"></a><a href="#footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></span>
that “the annals of the <span class="title">Péshdadi</span> (or Assyrian) race
must be obscure and fabulous; those of the Kayání
family, or the Medes and Persians, heroic and
poetic:” annals gathered from oral traditions
can be but such as the great Orientalist characterises
those of the mentioned dynasties. But it was
in his younger years, before he had enlarged his
views upon the history of mankind, that he fixed the
origin of the Persian monarchy so late as 890 years
before our era;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_93" id="fnanchor_93"></a><a href="#footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></span> afterwards, in India, he refuted his
former notions, and ranged more freely in the expanded
fields of antiquity. I shall add that Ferdusi
places the beginning of Gilshah’s reign 3529 years
before Christ, an epoch which receives synchronical
confirmation from our daily-increasing knowledge of
the antiquity of China, India, Assyria, Egypt, and
other states.</p>

<p><a name="Page_lxxix" id="Page_lxxix"></a><span class="pageno">lxxix</span>
The fundamental religion remains the same: a
celestial volume called <span class="title">Payman-i-farhang</span>, in perfect
accord with the Mahabadian code, is transmitted to
Kayomers. So the Dabistán: but, in the Desátir,
the four books ascribed to the first four Mahabadian
prophet-kings contain the purest deism, and although
the foundation of astrolatry and demonolatry
may be perceived in the cosmology of the first book,
yet these did not form a positive worship, which
develops itself in the seven planetary books of the
seven subsequent Persian kings, to wit: <span class="person">Kayomers</span>, <span class="person">Siamok</span>,
<span class="person">Hushang</span>, <span class="person">Tahmúras</span>, <span class="person">Jamshid</span>, <span class="person">Feridun</span>, and <span class="person">Menocheher</span>.
Under these monarchs, a particular worship
was rendered to the seven planets, as to mediators
between God and men; the description of the forms
under which they have been adored, is not, to my
knowledge, found in any other book but the Dabistán.</p>

<p>Superstition is certainly as ancient as human nature
itself; it is impossible to fix the epoch at
which particular opinions and practices originated,
such as the eighty-four sitting-postures at prayer;
the suppression of the breath for the abstraction
of thought; the mystical and fantastical notions
upon vision and revelation; and particularly the
belief that a man may attain the faculty to quit and
to reassume his body, or to consider it as a loose
garment, which he may put off at pleasure for ascending
<a name="Page_lxxx" id="Page_lxxx"></a><span class="pageno">lxxx</span>
to the world of light, and on his return be
reunited with the material elements. All these
matters are considered as very ancient.</p>

<p>We find in the Dabistán a curious account of Persian
sects under different names, such as <span class="title">Abadians</span>,
<span class="title">Azur-Húshangians</span>, <span class="title">Jamshaspians</span>, <span class="title">Samradians</span>, <span class="title">Khodaiyans</span>,
<span class="title">Radians</span>, <span class="title">Shidrangians</span>, <span class="title">Paikarians</span>, <span class="title">Milanians</span>,
<span class="title">Alarians</span>, <span class="title">Shidabians</span>, <span class="title">Akshiyans</span>. The founders of
these sects are placed so far back as the reigns of
Jamshid and Zohak. Individuals professing the
particular creed of each of these sects were living in
the time of the author of the Dabistán, who was
personally acquainted with several of them, and imparts
the information which he had himself received
from their lips. He gives with particular
care an account of the before-mentioned Azar Kaivan,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_94" id="fnanchor_94"></a><a href="#footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></span>
the chief of the later <span class="title">Abadíans</span> and <span class="title">Azar-Hushangians</span>.
The doctrine of these sectaries contained
peculiar notions about God’s nature and attributes,
and the world; the latter was to some an illusion;
God himself but an idea. To others, God
was every thing, to be served alone without a mediator
between him and mankind; the heavens and
the stars were his companions. God was the sun&mdash;fire&mdash;air&mdash;water&mdash;earth;
he was the essence of the
elements: from every one of these divine principles
<a name="Page_lxxxi" id="Page_lxxxi"></a><span class="pageno">lxxxi</span>
the heavens, stars, and the whole world proceeded.
These were some of the fundamental principles of
their metaphysical religion.</p>

<p>Their morality appears to have consisted in the
acknowledgment of all natural virtues; piety, justice,
charity, sobriety; wine and strong drinks
were forbidden; above all a tenderness towards all
living creatures was recommended; and the severity
against those who slew innoxious animals was
carried to such an excess, than even sons punished
their fathers with death, and fathers their
sons, for the slaughter of a sheep or an elk.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_95" id="fnanchor_95"></a><a href="#footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>Their political constitution appears from the earliest
time to have been that of an absolute monarchy:
this is the curse attached to Asiatics. The
king was to be of a noble descent, and bound to acknowledge
the <dfn>Farhang-Abad</dfn>, “code of Abad.” All
dignities, military and civil, were hereditary from
father to son. The royal court and inner apartments
appear to have been regulated in much the
same manner as they are still in Asia; his cup-bearers
and familiar servants, as well as those of his
sons, and other nobles, were always females.</p>

<p>The interior administration of cities and villages
is sufficiently detailed in the Dabistán. An active
police was established, with numerous spies and
<a name="Page_lxxxii" id="Page_lxxxii"></a><span class="pageno">lxxxii</span>
secret reporters, for the security of government.
We are glad to find in such early times hospitals for
the relief of the suffering, and caravansaras for the
convenience of travellers. Moreover, post-stations
of horses and messengers were distributed for the
rapid communication of news, from all sides of the
vast empire, to the monarch.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_96" id="fnanchor_96"></a><a href="#footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Not a little care was bestowed upon the discipline
and continual exercise of numerous armies. The
military chiefs were distinguished by the magnificent
decorations of their persons, horses, and arms,
in which they prided themselves. They were bound
to treat their soldiers kindly, nay, obliged to produce
certificates, from their subordinates, of having
behaved well towards them. An order of battle
was prescribed, in which they were to encounter the
enemy; no plunder after victory was permitted;
they never slew, nor treated with violence, a man
who had thrown down his arms and asked for
quarter.</p>

<p>History may well be referred to religion, which
is an ancient intellectual monument, living in the
human soul from generation to generation. I have
hitherto marked two religious periods: the first,
that of the <span class="title">Desátir</span>, through the Mahabadian dynasty;
<a name="Page_lxxxiii" id="Page_lxxxiii"></a><span class="pageno">lxxxiii</span>
the second, that of <span class="title">Paiman-í-Farhang</span>, prevailing
during the Pésh-dadi-race until the middle of the
Kayanian reign; I now come to the third.</p>

<p class="p2 unindent hanging"><abbr title="Section Three">§ III.</abbr>&mdash;<span class="sc">The Religion of Zardusht, or Zoroaster.</span></p>

<p>All religions are said to have deviated from their
primitive simplicity and purity, as men advanced
in knowledge and civilisation. This is true but in
a restricted and distinctive sense, and may be
explained, even without yielding to our habit of
considering that which is more remote and less
known as holier than that which is nearer and better
examined. Thus, we may admit that the impressions
made upon men in the first stage of expanding
reason are stronger and more vivid, the less
they are distracted by simultaneous and correlative
associations; one great idea is enough to fill their
whole mind, and admits of no rival, of no commixture
with any thing else; curiosity, versatility, luxuriancy
of intellect are not yet known; constancy is
a necessity in a small compass of ideas. We have
already touched<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_97" id="fnanchor_97"></a><a href="#footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></span> upon the powerful effect which
the early perception of the <em>Divine</em> produced upon
man: but he soon circumscribed what was too vast
<a name="Page_lxxxiv" id="Page_lxxxiv"></a><span class="pageno">lxxxiv</span>
or his comprehension in a perceptible object&mdash;heaven,
sun, fire, to which he offered his adoration;
he wanted a visible type or image of the invisible
Divinity; but, his means of formation being at first
very confined, he contented himself with the most
simple representation: he had a symbol, an idol in
a grove or cavern, but not yet a Pantheon. Simplicity
may be a mere restriction to one object or to
few objects; purity, nothing else but homogeneity in
good or bad, true or false; we shall not confound
them with rationality, which may subsist with multiplicity
and mixture. Thus, the adoration of one
deified man, one great serpent, one huge stone, is
by no means more rational than the worship of
numerous generations of gods, the ingenious personification
sof multiform nature, ever acknowledged
as the genuine offspring of the happy marriage
between intellect and imagination. In the
absence of arts and riches, worship is rude and destitute
of showy accessories. Afterwards, the development
of the understanding widens the field of
reasoning, the fertility of which may be attested
more by the shoot of weeds than by the growth of
fruits: error prevails over truth; the increase of
manifold resources facilitates and prompts superfetation
of exterior religion. Besides, the impressions,
by which the first legislator attached his followers
to his doctrine, are effaced by time; the first
<a name="Page_lxxxv" id="Page_lxxxv"></a><span class="pageno">lxxxv</span>
traditions, obscured, confused, and altered; faith is
weakened, and an opening made for change in
belief, practice, and morals. A change, merely as
such, is considered as a corruption by the adherents
of the old creed. Finally, revolutions, interior and
exterior, deteriorate or destroy religion and civilisation.</p>

<p>These reflexions, with the explanation previously
given as to the various notions of which the religions
in Asia were composed, will clearly show that, in the
course of ages, a reform of astrolatry, pyrolatry, and
idolatry, the branches of Sabæism and Mezdaism, became
desirable; and <span class="person">Zardusht</span>, or <span class="person">Zoroaster</span>, appeared.</p>

<p>In the notes placed at the bottom of the pages
containing Mohsan Fani’s account of Zoroaster,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_98" id="fnanchor_98"></a><a href="#footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></span>
will be found some of the principal results of the
investigations which have been made in Europe
respecting this legislator. The name of Zoroaster
was applied by some to the founder of Magism, or
Sabæism; we know also, that he has been identified
with many other prophets under different names,
among whom is <span class="person">Abraham</span>, called “the great Zardusht,”
and <span class="person">Hom</span>, of so extensive a celebrity, that
his name is mentioned by Strabo as predecessor of
Zoroaster. No wonder that the name of the latter
occurs in more or less remote times. According to
<a name="Page_lxxxvi" id="Page_lxxxvi"></a><span class="pageno">lxxxvi</span>
the Dabistán, he was born in Rai, a town in the
province of Jebal, or Irak Ajem, the country of the
ancient Parthians, and appeared as a reformer of
religion, under the reign of <span class="person">Gushtasp</span>, the fifth king
of the Kayanian dynasty, by the Occidental historians
generally identified with <span class="person">Darius Hystaspes</span>.
Although variously stated, this period is less subject
to chronological difficulties than are many others;
for, as Eastern and Western historians agree in the
epoch of Alexander’s death (321 B. C.), we may from
this, as from a fixed point, remount upwards to
Gushtasp; we find, according to some Orientals, five
reigns in 228 years,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_99" id="fnanchor_99"></a><a href="#footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></span> and therefore that of the said
king, beginning 549 years before our era, whilst,
according to the Occidentals, there are ten reigns
within 200 years, from Alexander’s conquest of
Persia to Darius Hystaspes, whose reign commences
in 521 A. D. The discrepancy of twenty-eight years
is far from being unexampled, even in more known
periods, and may in this case be most easily and
plausibly adjusted.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_100" id="fnanchor_100"></a><a href="#footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Page_lxxxvii" id="Page_lxxxvii"></a><span class="pageno">lxxxvii</span>
According to a wide-spread tradition, to which I
shall have occasion to return, Gushtasp was instructed
by Brahmans; pursuant to the Dabistán,
his brother Jamasp was the pupil of the Indian
<span class="person">Jangran-ghachah</span> (Sankara acharya)<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_101" id="fnanchor_101"></a><a href="#footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></span>. This sage, as
soon as he heard of Gushtasp’s listening to Zoroaster,
wrote an epistle to dissuade the king from the
adoption of the new creed; an interview took place
at Balkh between the Persian and Indian sages, and
the latter abandoned his religion upon hearing a
<dfn>nosk</dfn>, or chapter of the <span class="title">Zand-Avesta</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_102" id="fnanchor_102"></a><a href="#footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></span> This is the
name of the work attributed to Zoroaster himself, a
part of which was brought to Europe, in the year
1761, by Anquetil du Perron.</p>

<p><a name="Page_lxxxviii" id="Page_lxxxviii"></a><span class="pageno">lxxxviii</span>
The author of the Dabistán mentions the Zand-Avesta,
and declares the <span class="title">Mah-Zand</span> to be a portion
of the Desátir, and the Zand books in general conformable
to the Mahabadian code. The fifth Sassan,
the translator and commentator of the Desátir, in a
passage above-quoted,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_103" id="fnanchor_103"></a><a href="#footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></span> joins this work to the Avesta,
and is said in the Dabistán to have made a translation
of the code of Zardusht.</p>

<p>Great was the sensation caused among the learned
of Europe at the first appearance of the works attributed
to Zoroaster, published in French by Anquetil
du Perron, in 1771. In a note of this volume<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_104" id="fnanchor_104"></a><a href="#footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></span>
will be found the names of the principal authors
who declared themselves for or against the authenticity
of the Zoroastrian books. Among those who
combated it, sir William Jones was most conspicuous.
Seventy years have since elapsed, and a learned controversy
may now be considered as settled, nay,
entirely forgotten, in the course of a most eventful
historical period. Nevertheless, the Desátir is so
closely connected with the Zand-Avesta, that so
much having been said of the one, the other should
not be lightly discarded. The value and importance
of the Dabistán rest chiefly upon the support
of the two documents mentioned; on that account
I may hope to be pardoned if I here venture to repeat
<a name="Page_lxxxix" id="Page_lxxxix"></a><span class="pageno">lxxxix</span>
whatever facts and arguments appear to me
to have some bearing upon this work. But it was
sir William Jones who then roused the whole
learned public into lively attention, and, I dare presume,
that the subject may by itself at all times
excite considerable interest.</p>

<p>I shall quote the very words of lord Teignmouth
concerning the French author before mentioned:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_105" id="fnanchor_105"></a><a href="#footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></span>
“Anquetil had published in three quarto volumes
an account of his travels in India, the life of Zoroaster,
and some supposed works of that philosopher.
To this publication he prefixed a Discourse,
in which he treated the university of Oxford, and
some of its learned members and friends of Mr.
Jones, with ridicule and disrespect. From the
perusal of his works, Mr. Jones was little disposed
to agree with Monsieur du Perron in the
boasted importance of his communication; he was
disgusted with his vanity and petulance, and particularly
offended by his illiberal attack upon the
university, which he respected, and upon the
persons whom he esteemed and admired. The
letter which he addressed to M. du Perron was
anonymous; it was written with great force, and
expresses his indignation and contempt with a
<a name="Page_xc" id="Page_xc"></a><span class="pageno">xc</span>
degree of asperity which the judgment of maturer
years would have disapproved.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_106" id="fnanchor_106"></a><a href="#footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>The letter alluded to contains most severe remarks,
not only upon the Zand-Avesta, but also
upon Oriental studies in general: these are blows
so much more sensible to Orientalists, as they come
from a friendly and most revered hand. Such was
the ardor of a susceptible mind under the impression
of having to vindicate the honor of his friends,
that he forgot for a moment the wreath which he
had already won in the career of Oriental literature;
he had already composed his commentary upon
Asiatic poetry, and translated from the original Persian
the Life of Nadir-shah; he had then no presentiment
of the glory which he was destined to acquire
by collecting, under the Indian heaven, the lore of
antique Asia. As his French letter, written in a
very spirited and brilliant style, can never be read
without causing a great impression, I shall be permitted
to borrow from the writings of this celebrated
author himself some reflexions, which I think
necessary for placing in a right point of view Oriental
studies in general, and in particular the contents
of the Dabistán, inasmuch as these are in some parts
founded upon the Zand-Avesta, and in other points

If it were true, that Anquetil was wrong “to
affront death for procuring us useless lights&mdash;if
the writings of Zoroaster are a collection of galimatia&mdash;if
enlightened Europe had no need of his
Zand-Avesta, which he has translated to no purpose,
and upon which he uselessly spent eighteen
years, a time which ought to have been precious
to him&mdash;&mdash;”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_107" id="fnanchor_107"></a><a href="#footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></span> then any similar attempts which
have been or shall be made to procure, in Asia, and
to publish ancient historical documents, are equally
ridiculous and blamable. It is certainly not the
founder of a new era in Oriental literature whom we
hear in these words. Nobody knew better than he
that, in Asia, the cradle of mankind, we must search
for the most ancient documents to restore the lost
history of mankind; and if all endeavors were to
prove vain and useless, still the merit of having
attempted the attainment of a most laudable purpose
would remain. It is not unimportant to fix
the limits which researches can reach, and beyond
which nothing is to be gained; men are benefitted
and enriched at once by the saving of time and
trouble which preceding attempts teach; and by all
the acquisitions which better directions render
possible in a new and more profitable career.
Should the bold navigators who strive to arrive at
the pole never attain their aim, still would their
<a name="Page_xcii" id="Page_xcii"></a><span class="pageno">xcii</span>
endeavors be worthy of praise; the smallest fragment
of a rock, the slightest shoot of a plant,
plucked off in the desert of eternal ice, in latitude
eighty-eight, would at home be regarded with lively
interest, and navigation have not a little gained in
aid of other more fortunate undertakings.</p>

<p>But, who can like to read “puerile details, disgusting
descriptions, barbarous words&mdash;Zoroaster
could not have written such nonsense&mdash;either
he had no common sense, or he wrote not the
book which Anquetil attributed to him.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_108" id="fnanchor_108"></a><a href="#footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>As much has been and may be said of the books
attributed to other Asiatic legislators, who were
nevertheless revered as sacred during many ages by
numerous nations. Until we properly understand
the ignorance and habitual ideas of Asiatics, we
shall always remain ignorant of what is proverbially
called <span class="title">the wisdom of the East</span>. To appreciate
the just value of the ancient codes of laws, we ought
to represent to ourselves the primitive children of
the earth, as Prometheus describes them:</p>

<p>It will then be felt how important it was to break
the savage under the yoke of seemingly puerile
practices and customs. In a state which was not
unaptly called “the infancy of man,” it was by no
means absurd to ensure health by dietetical prescriptions,
cleanliness by obligatory ablutions, and
decency with convenience by a regulated dress; the
<dfn>koshti</dfn>, “the girdle,” of Zoroaster was then not so
unmeaning as it now appears to us. It was necessary
to educate the moral sense by appropriate
images, and to occupy conveniently, by fables, symbols,
and mythical accounts, the first active faculty
of the soul, imagination. Although those men who,
as legislators, were elevated above their barbarous
age, could in many points but partake in the general
imbecility and ignorance of an infant state
of society, they have nevertheless, among seemingly
childish and absurd precepts, promulgated most
luminous truths, better than which none have
hitherto been known, even at the most advanced
degree of civilisation. Any information above the
common understanding of the age is justly called
“a revelation,” and every nation has received some
<a name="Page_xciv" id="Page_xciv"></a><span class="pageno">xciv</span>
from their prophets, by which we have all benefited.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_110" id="fnanchor_110"></a><a href="#footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></span>
We, the youngest sons of science, ought to keep a
grateful and reverential remembrance of our elder
brothers. Let it be a subject of regret that, by the
maintenance of ancient institutions much longer
than was required for their intended purpose, the
intellectual growth of many Asiatic nations was
stopped; thus they now appear made for their laws,
whilst their laws were once made for them. After
these and similar reflexions, we shall view Zoroaster’s
hundred gates, and the remains of his twenty-one
nosks, as venerable monuments of an antique
civilisation, which ought never to be profaned by
derision.</p>

<p>Upon the Zand language, in which Zoroaster’s
laws were written, I refer to the great philologers
of our days, who have examined it&mdash;Rask,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_111" id="fnanchor_111"></a><a href="#footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></span> Bopp,
Burnouf, Lassen, and others: it is one of the most
important conquests made in archæology and philology,
and this we owe to Anquetil. When
<a name="Page_xcv" id="Page_xcv"></a><span class="pageno">xcv</span>
Jones<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_112" id="fnanchor_112"></a><a href="#footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></span> treated with such severity the publication of
this French author, he could not foresee that he
should one day call forth to notoriety the Dabistán,
which rests in great part upon the authority of
the Desátir, and these very books to which he refused
all authenticity. Mohsan Fani, one hundred
and twenty years before Anquetil, derived his information
probably from other copies of Zoroaster’s
works, and knew nothing of Western authors, yet
his statements agree with what the latter, before
and after our era related, and most particularly
with what the French discoverer published of that
ancient philosopher. Can it be supposed that all
these men of different nations, whose statements have
thus coincided during the lapse of more than two
thousand years, have “imposed upon themselves,
or been imposed upon by others concerning the
pretended laws of a pretended legislator?” Anquetil
deserved a better name than that of “a
French adventurer, who translated the books ascribed
to Zoroaster, from the translation of a certain
<a name="Page_xcvi" id="Page_xcvi"></a><span class="pageno">xcvi</span>
gypsy at Surat, and his boldness in sending
them abroad as genuine”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_113" id="fnanchor_113"></a><a href="#footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></span> was not unsupported
by judgment. If there was some folly and foppery
to deride in a young man, who spoke of his <cite>lilly-rosy
cheeks and elegant figure</cite>, there was no “<em>imposture</em>”
to detect, and too much acerbity shewn in retorting
thoughtless indiscretions, exaggerated into “<em>invectives</em>.”</p>

<p>Sir William Jones, when he published the strictures
which his antagonist, from pride or moderation,
never answered, was but in his twenty-fourth
year and under the influence of youthful ardor.
Eighteen years after, in a discourse, addressed to
the Asiatic Society of Calcutta, in 1789, he spoke
with more moderation of Anquetil as “having had
the merit of undertaking a voyage to India in his
earliest youth with no other view than to recover
the writings of Zoroaster.” The illustrious president
of that Society was not in the position to appreciate
Anquetil’s whole character, and died too soon
to become acquainted with the brilliant reputation
which the youthful voyager acquired in his maturer
years as a learned member of the French Academy
of Letters, both in his own country and abroad.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_114" id="fnanchor_114"></a><a href="#footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Page_xcvii" id="Page_xcvii"></a><span class="pageno">xcvii</span>
The Dabistán informs us, that the Zand-books are
of two kinds: the one, perspicuous and without
enigmatical forms of speech, is called the <span class="title">Mah-Zand</span>,
“great Zand;” the second, abounding in enigmatic
or figurative language, is entitled <span class="title">Kah-Zand</span>, “little
Zand.” The first, in most points speculative and
practical, agrees with the Desátir; the second is intended
to prevent philosophy falling into the hands
of the ignorant, to whom an enigmatical veil is
offered, whilst the sages know the true purport of
the pure doctrine. To king Gushtasp, his brother
Jamasp, his son Isfendiar, and to Bahman, the son
of the latter, were attributed the interpretations of
Zoroaster’s religious system, and many ingenious
<a name="Page_xcviii" id="Page_xcviii"></a><span class="pageno">xcviii</span>
parables which, for their moral sense, may be reckoned
among the best specimens of this kind of popular
instruction.</p>

<p>This true statement, contained in the Dabistan,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_115" id="fnanchor_115"></a><a href="#footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></span>
corrects the assertion of sir William Jones,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_116" id="fnanchor_116"></a><a href="#footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></span> that
Mohsan Fani affirms “the work of Zartusht to
“have been lost.” The learned Orientalist evidently
confounds the <span class="title">Mah-zand</span>, which is said to
be a portion of the Desátir, with the work of Zartusht.
The writer of the Dabistán enumerates<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_117" id="fnanchor_117"></a><a href="#footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></span> the
twenty-one <dfn>nosks</dfn> or books, of which the Zand was
composed; he says:<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></span> “At present there are fourteen
complete nosks, possessed by the Dosturs of
Karman; the other seven being incomplete, as,
through the wars and dissensions which prevailed
in Iran some of the nosks have disappeared, so
that, notwithstanding the greatest researches, the
nosks have come into their hands in a defective
state.” We find it expressly declared in the Dabistán,
on the authority<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_118" id="fnanchor_118"></a><a href="#footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></span> of the Dostur who wrote
the volume of the <span class="title">Sad dur</span>, “the hundred gates,”
that “the excellent faith has been received from the
prophet Zartusht.” In a particular section, intitled
<cite>Enumeration of some advantages which arise from the enigmatical</cite>
<a name="Page_xcix" id="Page_xcix"></a><span class="pageno">xcix</span>
<cite>forms of the precepts of Zartusht’s followers</cite>, Mohsan
not only adduces examples of Zartushtian allegories,
but subjoins his own interpretations of them; yet
he never <em>affirms</em>, nor even insinuates “the place of
Zoroaster’s lost works to have been supplied by a
recent compilation.” Nor can we assent to the
view, which sir W. Jones takes of the modern literature
of the Mobeds, “for whom,” he says,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_119" id="fnanchor_119"></a><a href="#footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></span> “as
they continued to profess among themselves the
religion of their forefathers, it became expedient
to supply the last or mutilated works of
their legislator by new compositions, partly from
their imperfect recollection, and partly from such
moral and religious knowledge as they gleaned,
most probably among the Christians with whom
they had an intercourse.”</p>

<p>To settle our judgment upon this subject, we
ought to recollect, that languages and precepts may
be transmitted from generation to generation by
oral instruction, which indeed was once the only
possible mode during a long period of time. It was
then that memory was so much stronger, as, destitute
of all artificial assistance, it depended solely
upon itself. We bought the advantage of writing
by resigning somewhat of memorial energy; this
was the evil, which, according to Plato, Thamus, the
<a name="Page_c" id="Page_c"></a><span class="pageno">c</span>
Egyptian king, predicted to Theut, the inventor of
writing. However this may be, it will appear founded
upon reason and history, that religious creeds, which
had once been the property of nations, are not easily
eradicated by any force, or forgotten under any circumstances;
they become living streams of ideas
and sentiments, which run uninterruptedly through
the ever-renewed races of man, even when these separate
from a parent stock. Hence we find, in
countries and among nations the most remote
from each other, so many notions and customs, the
origin of which is lost in the night of time. Shall
I mention the Jews, who, throughout the whole
world, repeat to-day the same words which they
learned more than thirty-three centuries ago?
With regard to the Guebres&mdash;sir W. Jones might
have safely granted a little more confidence to his
friend Bahman, his Persian reader, who always
named with reverence Zartusht, whose religion he
professed, in common with many so called Guebres.
For these it was not necessary “to preserve
Zoroastrian books, in sheets of lead or copper,
at the bottom of wells near Yezd:”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_120" id="fnanchor_120"></a><a href="#footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></span> this fact,
<a name="Page_ci" id="Page_ci"></a><span class="pageno">ci</span>
which Bahman used to assert, shows the particular
care which had once been taken to guard these
sacred documents, the veneration for which most
naturally prevented any falsification of their known
contents.</p>

<p>We are confirmed, by the author of the Dabistán,
that Zoroaster did not change the fundamentals of
the ancient religion; only the dualism of the principles,
good and bad, not existing, as I have remarked<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_121" id="fnanchor_121"></a><a href="#footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></span>
in the Mahabadian religion, was either then
first introduced, or only further developed; besides,
we see the cycle of 12,000 years fixed, and divided into
four periods of 3000 years each; we hear the promise
of a Saviour to restore the empire of God promulgated,
and the destruction of the world by fire
announced: this is at the same time the epoch of
the general resurrection, which is one of the most
remarkable dogmas of the Zoroastrian religion.</p>

<p>Although this be not destitute of religious observances,
yet we find scarce any painful austerity recommended.
The twenty-fifth gate of Zoroaster
contains the remarkable precept: “Know that in
thy faith there is no fasting except that of avoiding
sin: in which sense thou must fast the whole
year.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_122" id="fnanchor_122"></a><a href="#footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></span> The ancient Mahabadian religion, although
adulterated before, during, and after Zoroaster’s
<a name="Page_cii" id="Page_cii"></a><span class="pageno">cii</span>
life, seems to have never lost its grave character
and solemnity. In the Zand-books known
to us, no trace of temples, altars, or religious symbols
exist. Herodotus knew of none; the fire-places
were upon a desert place, or upon mountains; the
fire upon the ground. Upon the Persian monuments
which time has spared, upon the walls of the
thousand-pillared palace of Isfahan, and upon those
of the Royal tombs we see no idols, but priests and
kings, performing the sacrifice of fire before their
<em>fervers</em>, “ideals of virtue and sanctity,” and other
actions rather of a political than religious character.
The pyræa, round and concave, represented the
vault of heaven. Nevertheles other accounts permit
us to believe, that, by association with other
nations; most likely by the introduction of sculpture,
architecture, and painting; and, as the Dabistán
expressly says, by the use of symbolical language:
a superstitious worship of sacred places
and symbolic images gained a great ascendancy.</p>

<p>This religion prevailed during the times of the
Kayanian kings from Gushtasp to Dara the Second,
during more than two centuries. After the conquest
of Persia by Alexander, a political and religious
revolution took place in this country, and extended
to Greece, where, according to the commentary
of the Desátir, the creed of the <span class="title">Gushaspians</span> was
introduced. This is declared to be a medium between
<a name="Page_ciii" id="Page_ciii"></a><span class="pageno">ciii</span>
the <em>Illuminated</em> and the <em>Rationalists</em>, perhaps
the same which the Dabistán calls the faith of the
<dfn>Beh-dinians</dfn>, “professors of the better religion.” So
much is avowed by Philo, Plinius, and others&mdash;and
we have reason to lay stress upon this avowal&mdash;that
at one time the so called barbarians were reckoned
to be more wise and virtuous than the Greeks.
During the Ashkanian dynasty (from the third century
B. C. to the end of the second after our era),
the people conformed to the <span class="title">Kah-zand</span>, that is,
yielded to the superstition, which the figurative language
was apt to suggest. Ardeshir, the first Sassanian,
in the beginning of the third century A. D.;
endeavored to re-establish the ancient religion; but,
after his reign of forty years, the Kah-zand took
and kept the ascendancy, until the Persian empire
fell before the overwhelming power of the Muhammedans.
The Mah-zand was lost during the domination
of the intolerant invaders, Greeks, Arabs,
and Turks; the Kah-zand still remains in some of
its parts, whilst many others were lost in the successive
disorders of the state.</p>

<p>The fifteenth and last section of the first chapter
treats of <span class="person">Mazdak</span>, who lived in the fifth century of
our era. We are informed of the existence of a
book, called <span class="title">Desnak</span>, which the author of the Dabistán
saw, and which contains the doctrine of this
reformer. This was nothing else than the Zoroastrian
<a name="Page_civ" id="Page_civ"></a><span class="pageno">civ</span>
system about the two principles, <dfn>Yezed</dfn>, “God”
or “light,” and <dfn>Ahriman</dfn>, “agent of evil” or “darkness,”
with a few peculiarities which did not
destroy the fundamental principles of the original
religion. But, it was the ethical part of his doctrine
which at first caused a great revolution, and at last
the destruction of the teacher and his numerous
disciples, Mazdak bade all men to be partners in
riches and women, just as they are of fire, water,
and grass; private property was not to exist; each
man to enjoy or to endure, in his turn, the good and
bad lots of this world. To this strange doctrine
may be perhaps applied the saying of a great bishop
(Bossuet): that “every error is but an abuse of
some truth.” To prevent an excessive inequality
of fortunes in society was the object towards
which celebrated ancient legislators tended, and for
which frequently wishes were expressed, reforms
projected, and politico-philosophical romances<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_123" id="fnanchor_123"></a><a href="#footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></span> composed
by well-meaning and respectable persons.
It is therefore to a natural, but dangerous propensity
of the human mind, that we ought to refer
Mazdak’s bold and for some time too successful attempt,
as well as all the doctrines of the same tendency,
which before and after him were and will
henceforth be proposed.</p>

 See sir John Malcolm’s History of Persia. Ferdusi counts 304 years
from Alexander’s death to the beginning of Gushtasp’s reign; but he
assigns to the latter 120, and 112 to that of his successor <span class="person">Bahman Arjer</span>,
or <span class="person">Ardishir diraz</span> (Artaxerxes longimanus). These two reigns might
have comprised those of several others not mentioned by Ferdusi.</p>

 The duration of the whole Kayanian dynasty is stated by the Orientals
(see <abbr title="volume one page">vol. I. p.</abbr> 31, <a href="#footnote_251">note 1</a> of this work) to be 704 years in 10 reigns;
according to Occidental historians, it is only 380 years in 18 reigns. The
first statement is evidently erroneous as to the small number of kings,
but it is not decided that it is equally so as to the duration of the whole
dynasty. The error is more likely to be in the list of the kings than in
the whole period of their reigns. May I be permitted to refer to my
discussion upon the chronology of the <span class="title">Rajatarangini</span> (<abbr title="volume two page">vol. II. p.</abbr> 387)?</p>

 Sir William Jones says (Works, <abbr title="volume Three page">vol. III. p.</abbr> 128): “It was he (Zoroaster)&mdash;not
as Ammianus asserts, his protector, Gushtasp&mdash;who travelled
in India, that he might receive information from the Brahmans in
theology and ethics.” This is not to be found in the edition of Calcutta,
nor in the manuscript of the Dabistán which D. Shea and myself have seen.</p>

 Mr. Eugène Burnouf, when he communicated to me his opinion upon
the derivation of the word <dfn>Wasátir</dfn> (see <a href="#Page_xxii">p. xxii</a>), adverted incidentally
to that of the term <span class="title">Zand-Avesta</span>, interpreted sometimes “the <span class="title">Zand</span> and
the <span class="title">Usta</span>,” and said, that these words are found in perhaps a single
passage of the books of Zoroaster, to wit, <span class="trans">huzanth vacha vaidhya cha</span>.
These two words are applied to <dfn>mantras</dfn> (prayers), and seem to signify
“which will give life,” or “which are salutary to towns and nations,”
and “which are learned.” We recognise the Sanscrit <span class="trans">sujantu</span> and

 Sir W. J. says (see his Works, <abbr title="volume Three page">vol. III. p.</abbr> 116) that, according to
his conviction, the dialect of the Guebrs, which they pretend to be that
of Zertusht, of which Bahman, a Guebr and his Persian reader, gave him
a variety of written specimens, is a late invention of their priests. What
language does he mean? certainly not that of the Zand-Avesta, of which
he speaks in particular, and states (<cite>ibid.</cite>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 118) “the language of the
Zand was at least a dialect of the Sanscrit, approaching, perhaps, as
nearly to it as the Prácrit, or other popular idioms, which we know to
have been spoken in India two thousand years ago.”</p>

 Anquetil composed a number of Memoirs, read to the French Institut
and preserved in their printed records. He published, in 1771, three
quarto volumes upon his voyages to, in, and from India, and the Works
of Zoroaster; in 1798, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’Inde en rapport avec l’Europe; in 1799, La
Legislation orientale, ou le despotisme considéré dans la Turquie, la
Perse et l’Indostane</cite>. An epistle which he placed before his Latin translation
of <cite>Dara Shuko’s Persian Upanishad</cite>, and addressed to the Brahmans
of India, contained, as it were, his religious and political testament. He
declares his nourishment to have been reduced, like that of an abstemious
ascetic, living, even in winter, without fire; and sleeping in a bed without
feathers or sheets. His juvenile boast of “personal beauty” was expiated
by total neglect of his body, left “with linen unchanged and unwashed;”
his aspirations to “a vast extent of learning” had subsided into patient
and most persevering studies. But, disdaining to accept gifts and pensions,
even from government, he preserved his absolute liberty, and
blessed his poverty, “as the salvation of his soul and body, the rampart
of morality and of religion; a friend of all men; victorious over the
allurements of the world” he tended towards the Supreme Being.
Well may virtues so rare efface other human failings of Anquetil du
Perron. He died, in his seventy-fourth year, in 1805.&mdash;(See <cite>Histoire et

 Yezd, in central Persia, is the ancient Isatichæ of Ptolemy. It is
celebrated on account of the fire-worship of <span class="title">Yezdan</span> (or Ormuzd, as light),
there practised, and as the last asylum of the adherents to Zoroaster’s
religion, who fled before the Muhammedans. From thence the fire-worshippers
sought a refuge in India, and settled in Diu, Bombay, and in
the higher valleys of the Indus and the Ganges.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><abbr title="Section Four">§ IV.</abbr>&mdash;<span class="sc">The Religion of the Hindus.</span></p>

<p>The theatre upon which the author of the Dabistán
begins history from the remotest times, is
Persia, without limitation of its extent, probably
including Chaldæa. From thence he passes to India,
he says little of any other country; nothing at
all of Egypt. The delta of this most fertile land,
as an alluvial formation of the great river Nile, was
necessarily posterior to the existence of inland regions;
still its claims to antiquity are very high and
not unsupported, to a certain extent, by the best
written testimonies and architectural monuments.
If I here refer in a cursory manner to its eras,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_124" id="fnanchor_124"></a><a href="#footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></span> it is
to strengthen what was above remarked concerning
the general belief of the great age of the world. The
ancient religion of Egypt, although connected and
<a name="Page_cvi" id="Page_cvi"></a><span class="pageno">cvi</span>
conformable in many points with other Asiatic religions,
is never alluded to by the author of the Dabistán,
probably because in his time the Egyptians
had lost even the memory of their ancient history,
which very little attracted the curiosity of their
masters, the Muhammedans, except perhaps by the
medium of the Bible of the Jews, often quoted in
their Koran.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_125" id="fnanchor_125"></a><a href="#footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>I cannot here omit briefly noticing the various opinions
of several learned men concerning the comparative
antiquity of the Magi, the Egyptian priests,
and the Hindu philosophers. Aristotle<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_126" id="fnanchor_126"></a><a href="#footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></span> believed
the Magi more ancient than the Egyptians; Diodorus
of Sicily<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_127" id="fnanchor_127"></a><a href="#footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></span> believed the Hindus to have never
sent nor received colonies, and invented every art
and science; Lucian, Philostratus<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_128" id="fnanchor_128"></a><a href="#footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></span>,
and Eusebius<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_129" id="fnanchor_129"></a><a href="#footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></span>
granted anteriority in philosophy to the Hindus
over the Egyptians. In our times the learned abbé
Mignot established in three Memoirs<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_130" id="fnanchor_130"></a><a href="#footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></span>, that the Hindus
<a name="Page_cvii" id="Page_cvii"></a><span class="pageno">cvii</span>
owed nothing to the Egyptians, and traced the
true communications of the former with several nations
of Asia and Europe. But sir W. Jones declared
in 1785<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_131" id="fnanchor_131"></a><a href="#footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></span>, as not ill-grounded, the opinion
that Ethiopia and Hindostan were peopled or colonized
by the same extraordinary race, or that the
Ethiopians of Meroe were the same people as the
Hindus. His opinion was reproduced under different
forms by Hennel, Wilford, Forbes, Carwithen, among
the English, and adopted by L. Langles among the
French. I need not dwell upon this opinion, as
the grounds upon which it rested are now considered
as entirely destroyed. Sir W. Jones himself
seems to have abandoned it in 1789,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_132" id="fnanchor_132"></a><a href="#footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></span> as the Dabistán
appeared to him to furnish an unexceptionable evidence,
that the Iranian monarchy must have been
the oldest in the world, although, he added, it will
remain dubious to which of the three stocks, Hindu,
Arabian, or Tartar, the first kings of Iran belonged;
or whether they sprang from a fourth race, distinct
from any of the others; He further states, that no
country but Persia seems likely to have sent forth
colonies to all the kingdoms of Asia, and that the
three races (Indians, Arabs, Tartars) migrated from
Iran as from their common country, “the true centre
of population, of knowledge, of languages, and
<a name="Page_cviii" id="Page_cviii"></a><span class="pageno">cviii</span>
of arts; which, instead of travelling westward
only, as it has been fancifully supposed, or eastward,
as might with equal reason have been asserted,
were expanded in all directions to all the
regions of the world, in which the Hindu race
had settled under various denominations.”</p>

<p>The second chapter of the Dabistán describes, in
twelve sections, the religious systems and customs
of the Hindus. It is a detailed account, given by a
Persian who, as traveller and resident in India
during about thirty years, had the best opportunities
to collect right information; he shows himself
acquainted with the canonical books of this nation;
he quotes their Puránas, and other works less
known.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_133" id="fnanchor_133"></a><a href="#footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>The Hindus are, among all nations, most particularly
distinguished by a decided turn for metaphysics,
which even tinctured the radicals of their
language; they have labored more than others to
solve, exhaust, comprehend, what is insolvible,
inexhaustible, incomprehensible. To give a general
notion of their metaphysical theology, I do not say
<a name="Page_cix" id="Page_cix"></a><span class="pageno">cix</span>
to render it intelligible, would require an extensive
treatise. We will now give a few characteristic
and leading features of their systems as indicated in
the Dabistán.</p>

<p>Some of their theological philosophers made incredible
efforts to steer clear of anthropomorphism
in their conceptions of the Divinity: their Brahm, in
the neuter gender, has no symbol, nor image, nor
temple; they generally profess the great principle
of <em>emanation of all existences from a common but unknown
source</em>. God is the producer of the beginning
and end, exhibiting himself in the mirror of pure
space. Creation is held to have proceeded from
pure space and time. Other Hindu philosophers
establish: 1. a primary, subtile, universal substance,
undergoing modification through its own energy.
This they call <dfn>Mula Prakritti</dfn>, “rudimental nature,”
no production but the root of all, involving, 2. <em>seven
principles</em>, which are productions and productive
(that is, intellect, egotism, and five subtile elements);
from these seven proceed: 3. <em>sixteen productions</em> (to
wit, eleven organs and five gross elements); to these
just mentioned twenty-four (namely, Nature, seven
principles and sixteen productions); add, 4. <em>the soul</em>,
which is neither a production, nor productive, and
you have the <em>twenty-five physical and metaphysical categories</em>
of the Sankhya philosophy.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_134" id="fnanchor_134"></a><a href="#footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></span> This strikes us
<a name="Page_cx" id="Page_cx"></a><span class="pageno">cx</span>
as a very specious methodical arrangement of an
abstruse matter, which is not thereby in any degree
rendered more intelligible.</p>

<p>We seem to understand something more when, as
in the Vedenta philosophy, it is said of the truly-existing
Being (God):<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_135" id="fnanchor_135"></a><a href="#footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></span> “that he has exhibited the
“world and the heavens in the field of existence,
but has nothing like an odor of being, nor taken a
color of reality; and this manifestation is called
<dfn>Máya</dfn> that is, ‘the Magic of God,’ because
the universe is his playful deceit, and he is
the bestower of imitative existence, himself the
unity of reality. With this pure substance, like
an imitative actor, he passes every moment into
another form. He, manifesting his being and
unity in three persons, separate from each other,
formed the universe. The connexion of the spirits
with the holy Being is like the connexion of
the billows with the ocean, or that of sparks with
fire.” This is pure idealism; but man will spontaneously
break through the shadowy illusion, and
grasp at some reality; the trinity of the Hindus became
<em>creation</em>, <em>preservation</em>, and <em>destruction</em> (or renovation),
the history of nature before their eyes.</p>

<p>I shall here remark, without attempting to explain,
the striking contrast in the religion of the
same nation between the most subtile
metaphysic
<a name="Page_cxi" id="Page_cxi"></a><span class="pageno">cxi</span>
theology and the grossest idolatry. In the latter, the
symbolical representation prevails; it is known,
that in its immoderate use they have entirely abandoned
the normal proportions of the human form,
and by the multiplication of members banished all
fitness and beauty. Their plastic and graphic typification
of an all-mighty, all-bestowing, and all-resuming
God, with its three, four, five heads, so many and
more arms, is repulsive; in their poetry he frightens
us with innumerable mouths, eyes, breasts,
arms, and legs, grinding between his teeth the generations
of men, who precipitate themselves into
his mouth like rivers into the ocean, or flies into
fire.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_136" id="fnanchor_136"></a><a href="#footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>The psychology of the Hindus is not less abstruse
than the rest of their metaphysics. We have already
mentioned the soul among the twenty-five categories
as neither a production nor productive. The
Indian philosophers distinguish spirit and soul,
that is, a rational soul and a mere sensitive principle.
The first is supposed enveloped with a
subtile, shadowy form of the most delicate material
ether. Some hold the soul to be incased in three
sheaths, the intellectual, the mental, and the organic
or vital sheath.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_137" id="fnanchor_137"></a><a href="#footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></span> According to different views the
vital spirit is <dfn>Máya</dfn> herself, or an emanation of Máyá,
<a name="Page_cxii" id="Page_cxii"></a><span class="pageno">cxii</span>
in any case the illusive manifestation of the universe.</p>

<p>This ingenuous conception seems to have taken
deep and complete possession of the Hindus; it dominates
in their most subtile abstractions, and embodies
itself in a thousand forms to their vivid and
luxuriant imagination. The <span class="title">Saktians</span>, a sect wedded
to sensual materialism, represent Máyá as a <dfn>Saktí</dfn> or
energy of Siva; she is “the mother of the universe;”
“non-entity finds no access to this creator, the
garment of perishableness does not sit right upon
the body of this fascinating empress; the dust of
nothingness does not move round the circle of
her dominion; the real beings and the accidental
creatures of the nether world are equally enamoured
and intoxicated with desire before her.”
Above the six circles, into which the Hindus divide
the human body, is “the window of life, and the
passage of the soul, which is the top and middle
of the head, and in that place is the <em>flower of the
back</em> of one thousand leaves: this is the residence
of the glorious divinity, that is, of the world-deceiving
queen, and in this beautiful site reposes
her origin. With the splendor of one hundred
thousand world-illuminating suns, she wears, at
the time of rising, manifold odoriferous herbs
and various flowers upon her head, and around
her neck: her resplendent body is penetrated
<a name="Page_cxiii" id="Page_cxiii"></a><span class="pageno">cxiii</span>
with perfumes of divers precious ingredients,
such as musk, safran, sandal, and amber, and
bedecked with magnificent garments; in this manner,
she is to be represented.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_138" id="fnanchor_138"></a><a href="#footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></span> Thus we see the
poetical imagination of the Hindus, playing, as it
were, with abstruseness, materializing what is spiritual,
and spiritualizing what is material.</p>

<p>Characteristic of and peculiar to the Hindus, are
their conceptions relative to the states of the embodied
soul, which are chiefly three: “<dfn>waking</dfn>, <dfn>dreaming</dfn>,
and <dfn>profound sleep</dfn>.”<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></span> In these three conditions
the soul is imprisoned, but it may, by virtue
and sanctity, break the net of illusion, that is, acquire
the consciousness of the illusion which captivates
it, and know that, even when awake, man is
dreaming: this is the triumph of his perfection.</p>

<p>Such, and other notions, in their development
and application, form a system of metaphysics, in
which excess and abuse of refined speculations lose
themselves in obscurity, contradiction, and absurdity.</p>

<p>Among the Indian sectaries appear the <span class="title">Charvak</span>,
who, rejecting the popular religion, follow their own
system of philosophic opinions.</p>

<p>Of <span class="title">Buddha</span> and the <span class="title">Buddhists</span>, we are disappointed
to find so little in the Dabistán, except the important
information that Vichnu, in order to destroy the demons
<a name="Page_cxiv" id="Page_cxiv"></a><span class="pageno">cxiv</span>
and evil genii, the agents of night, assumed the
avatár of Buddha when ten years only of the Dwaparyug
remained, that is, 3112 years before Christ. In
the section on the tenets held by the followers of
Buddha, these religionists are called <span class="title">Jatis</span> or <span class="title">Yatis</span>, a
great number of whom are corn-traders and get their
livelihood as servants; they are divided in several
classes, and do not believe the incarnations of the
deity; as to the rest, they have tenets and customs
in common with other Indian sects, only distinguishing
themselves by a great aversion to Brahmans,
and an extreme care of not hurting animal
life.</p>

<p>In the whole account, which the Dabistán gives
of the various sects and doctrines of the Hindus,
we can but remark a frequent confusion of Indian
with Muhammedan notions and stories. Indeed,
this work having been written in India at a time
when, after a sojourn of more than seven centuries,
about twenty millions of Muselmans appeared, as it
were, lost in the midst of one hundred millions of
Hindus, we cannot wonder that a mutual assimilation
in opinions and customs took place among individuals
of both religions. A remarkable instance
of it presents itself in the person of <span class="person">Kabir</span>, renowned
in his time for sanctity. After his death, both the
Hindus and Muhammedans claimed his corpse for
funeral honors; monuments erected to him by each
<a name="Page_cxv" id="Page_cxv"></a><span class="pageno">cxv</span>
party exist in our days, with the proverbial precept
which originated from this event:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Live so as to be claimed after death to be burnt by Hindus, and to
be buried by Muslims.”</p>

<p>The Indian Yogis, Sanyásis, and Vairagis are perpetually
confounded with Muhammedan Durvishes,
and Sufis, of whom hereafter.</p>

<p>We do not fail to meet with many traces of the
ancient Persian astrolatry and pyrolatry among the
Indians. Mohsan mentions the <span class="title">Surya-makhan</span> (<span class="title">Sauras</span>),
“worshippers of the sun,” and periphrases,
as addressed to that luminary, a Sanscrit prayer,
which seems to be one of those called <span class="title">gayátri</span>, the
holiest verses of the Vedas, kept as mysterious by
the Brahmans, and pronounced with the deepest
sense of concentrated devotion. In our days, more
than one <span class="title">gayátri</span> has been made known.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_139" id="fnanchor_139"></a><a href="#footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></span> We cannot
doubt that (according to the poet)<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_140" id="fnanchor_140"></a><a href="#footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></span><span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“That vast source of liquid light, the ethereal sun, which perpetually
laves heaven with ever-renewed brightness,”</p>

<p class="unindent">was, from the remotest times, the object of adoration
in India. The Dabistán mentions also the
<span class="title">Chandra-bakhtra</span>, “worshippers of the moon.”
Even in our days we find the veneration for the
<a name="Page_cxvi" id="Page_cxvi"></a><span class="pageno">cxvi</span>
sun, the planets, and fire, openly practised by the
Hindus. The worshippers of the latter elements
called <span class="title">Sagníkas</span>, are very numerous at Benares;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_141" id="fnanchor_141"></a><a href="#footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></span> they
keep many <dfn>agni-hotras</dfn>, “burnt-offerings,” continually
blazing; they kindle, with two pieces of
sacred wood, called <dfn>sámi</dfn>, a fire, never extinguished
during their lives, for the performance of solemn
sacrifices, their nuptial ceremonies, the obsequies
of departed ancestors, and their own funeral pile.
There are besides particular worshippers of the
wind, water, earth, and the three kingdoms of nature.
The latter are called <span class="title">Tripujas</span>, “trinitarians.”
We find also <span class="title">Manushya-bhakta</span>, “worshippers
of mankind,” who recognise the being of
God in man, and believe nothing to be more perfect
than mankind; like <span class="person">Channing</span>, a famous American
preacher of our days. In short, the worship
of personified nature, in its utmost extent, is most
evident in what we know of the Vedas, and never
ceased to be the general religion of the Hindus.</p>

<p>Not without interest will be read in the Dabistán
the account of <span class="person">Nanak</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_142" id="fnanchor_142"></a><a href="#footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></span>
the founder of the Sikh religion
and domination. He is there represented as
having been, in a former age, <span class="person">Janaka</span>, sovereign of
Mithila, and father of Sitá, the wife of Rama. The
revolution effected by Nanak, in the middle of the
<a name="Page_cxvii" id="Page_cxvii"></a><span class="pageno">cxvii</span>
sixteenth century, proves that the Hindus are not
quite so unchangeable in religion and customs as is
generally believed. It is however to be remarked,
that the Panj-ab, the country of the Sikhs, was
always considered by the Brahmans as the seat of
heterodoxy (probably Buddhism), and blamed for
irregularity of manners. Mohsan’s account will be
found to add confirmation and a few particulars to
that given of Nanak, from the best sources&mdash;the
generals sir John Malcolm, and John Briggs.</p>

<p>What will appear most valuable in this work is
the description of various usages, some of which
have never been described elsewhere. The most
ancient customs are brought to recollection. Thus,
we find stated, on the authority of Maha bharat,
that widows could formerly take other husbands&mdash;married
women, with the consent of their husbands,
maintain intercourse with other men&mdash;several
individuals, of the same race and religion,
espouse one wife among them;&mdash;in ancient times
there existed no such practice as appropriation of
husband and wife; every woman being allowed to
cohabit with whomsoever she liked; conjugal fidelity
was only in later times made a duty. Much of what
he describes may be seen, even in our days, in India,
where all the degrees of civilisation which the Hindus
ever attained, from the lowest to the highest,
occur here and there within a small compass of
<a name="Page_cxviii" id="Page_cxviii"></a><span class="pageno">cxviii</span>
country. So constant are they in good and bad!
The whole of antiquity is still living in India, and
Herodotus stands confirmed in what appeared most
incredible in his narrative by the testimonies of Mohsan
Fáni, the reverend abbe Dubois,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_143" id="fnanchor_143"></a><a href="#footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></span>
Ward, and
others. The Persian author intersperses his account
with anecdotes which characterise in the most
lively manner individuals, sects, and tribes. If now
and then we must avert our eyes from disgusting
scenes of human degradation, more frequently we
admire man, even in his errors, for the power and
command of the mental over the physical part of
his nature. The naked Yogi, who inflicts the most
cruel tortures upon himself, wants but a better
motive for being justly extolled as a hero of fortitude;
death appears to him an habitual companion,
into whose arms he sinks without fear; overpowered
by malady, he buries himself alive.</p>

<p>We may be astonished at the number of unbelievers
<a name="Page_cxix" id="Page_cxix"></a><span class="pageno">cxix</span>
among the Hindus of whom we read, and at
the licentiousness of their opinions, expressed with
a strength which we should think carried to excess.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_144" id="fnanchor_144"></a><a href="#footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></span>
We perceive also that, in contradiction to common
belief, in the midst of the seventeenth century, when
the Dabistán was composed (1645 A. D.) a numerous
class of Indians assumed the name of Muselmans,
but it must be remarked, that the Hindus neither
endeavor to make, nor easily admit, proselytes: because
their religion depends much less upon creed,
in which they are latitudinarians, than upon the
fixed customs of their castes, the character of which,
being derived from birth, cannot be transferred to
strangers.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_145" id="fnanchor_145"></a><a href="#footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></span>
We shall see hereafter in what manner
Hindus and Muhammedans may be confounded with
each other.</p>

<p>So much of India being known in our days, we
have the facility of trying the veracity and correctness
of the Dabistán concerning this country. Its
account will be found, I dare say, rather incomplete
in the small compass in which so extensive a subject
was inclosed, but not inaccurate in the greatest part
of its various statements. Sir W. Jones<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_146" id="fnanchor_146"></a><a href="#footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></span>
bears Mohsan
Fani the testimony, “that his information concerning
<a name="Page_cxx" id="Page_cxx"></a><span class="pageno">cxx</span>
the Hindus is wonderfully correct.” Let
us compare the account given by him with all that
has been published about India by the best instructed
Europeans before the foundation of the Asiatic Society
of Bengal, and we shall regret that the Dabistán
was brought into notice so late. Whatever it
be, the particular views of a Persian, through a
medium of education, religion, and custom, so different

 According to Manetho, a high-priest of Heliopolis, the Egyptians
counted 53,525 years; they saw twice the sun set where he now rises&mdash;they
saw (as well as the Chaldeans) the ecliptic perpendicular upon the
equator before 39,710 years. Herodotus (<abbr title="liber Two">lib. II</abbr>) attributes to them,
more moderately, 15,882 historical years.</p>

 The history of Joseph, Pharaoh, Moses in Egypt, is often referred to
by Muhammed and his followers; they state that the Egyptian king professed
a religion unlike that mentioned by Greek authors, with whom the
Bible also disagrees. In general, monotheism is adverse to the examination
of polytheistical systems, and seldom accurate in the representation
of their tenets.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p class="p2 center"><abbr title="Section Five">§ V.</abbr>&mdash;<span class="sc">Retrospect of the Persian and Indian
Religions.</span></p>

<p>I have endeavored to trace the most remarkable
features of Persian and Indian religions from among
those which are contained in the Dabistán. In
them we recognise resemblances, and, in more than
one point, even coincidences, which appear not
merely taken from each other in the course of time,
but rather originally inwoven in the respective institutions.
This may be explained, partly by the general
probability that nations, passing through the
same stages of civilisation, might agree in several
parts of religion, politics, and philosophy, and
<a name="Page_cxxi" id="Page_cxxi"></a><span class="pageno">cxxi</span>
chiefly by the fact, now generally admitted among
the learned,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_147" id="fnanchor_147"></a><a href="#footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></span>
that in very remote times, a union of all
the Arian nations, among whom the Persians and
Indians are counted, existed in the common
regions of central Asia. Sir W. Jones<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_148" id="fnanchor_148"></a><a href="#footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></span>
goes so far
as to say: “We cannot doubt that the book of
Mahabad, or Manu, written in a celestial dialect,
means the Veda.” William von Schlegel most
ingeniously surmises,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_149" id="fnanchor_149"></a><a href="#footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></span>
“that the name of <span class="title">Zand</span> may
be but a corruption of the Sanscrit word <dfn>chhandas</dfn>,
one of the most usual names of the Vedas.”
The fourteen Mahabadians are to him: “Nothing
else but the fourteen Manus, past and future, of
the Brahmanical mythology.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_150" id="fnanchor_150"></a><a href="#footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></span>
Thus we should
have to thank Mohsan Fani for a confirmation of the
above-stated historical fact; the <span class="title">Mahabadians</span> were
nothing else but <dfn>Mahabodhis</dfn>, in good Sanscrit, “great
deified teachers;” he would have placed them,
as did lately Burnouf, Lassen, and Charles Ritter,
<a name="Page_cxxii" id="Page_cxxii"></a><span class="pageno">cxxii</span>
somewhere on the highlands of Iran, and he <em>invented</em>
nothing.</p>

<p>From the ante-historical dynasties descending to
later times, let us consider that, according to respectable
traditions,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_151" id="fnanchor_151"></a><a href="#footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></span>
there existed friendly and hostile
relations between Iran and Persia in the time of the
Iranian king <span class="person">Feridun</span>, 1729 years before our era: he
reconducted with an army a fugitive Indian prince,
and rendered India tributary. Two other invasions
took place under the Persian monarch <span class="person">Manucheher</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_152" id="fnanchor_152"></a><a href="#footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></span>
after which the Indians recovered their liberty.
Under Kai Kobad<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_153" id="fnanchor_153"></a><a href="#footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></span>
flourished Rustum, who ruled,
beside other countries, Sejistan and Kabul, conquered
the Panj-áb, and carried war into the bosom
of Arya varta. This country was also attacked by
Afrasiab, a Turan prince,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_154" id="fnanchor_154"></a><a href="#footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></span>
then possessor of Persia.
Ferdusi’s Shah-namah indicates expeditions of Feramurs,
a son of Rustum, to India, under the reign
of Kai Khosrú. We arrive at the epoch of Gushtasp,
who ordered the Indus to be explored, and
<a name="Page_cxxiii" id="Page_cxxiii"></a><span class="pageno">cxxiii</span>
although he had not, as Herodotus asserts,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_155" id="fnanchor_155"></a><a href="#footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></span>
conquered
the Indians, he entertained religious relations
with that nation. After Alexander’s conquest
of Persia, Sassan, the son of Dara, retired to
Hind, where, devoted to the service of God, he
died.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_156" id="fnanchor_156"></a><a href="#footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></span>
After a very obscure period of Persian history,
Ardeshir, directed by a dream, brought an
offspring of Sassan from Kabulistan to Istakhar.
We cannot doubt that at all times a communication
was open between Iran and India, where Bahram
Gor married an Indian princess, and whence Nushirvan
received a celebrated book and the game of
chess. In our seventh century, the Muhammedan
Arabians, driven by the spirit of conquest, turned
their arms towards India, but stopped on the borders
of the Indus. It was reserved to Muhammedan
Moghuls, mixed with Persians, to establish in the
midst of India an empire which, after eight hundred
years, disjoined by various disorders, fell into the
hands of the English.</p>

<p>This rapid sketch is perhaps sufficient to explain
any mixture, fusion, and resemblance of Persian and
Indian doctrines and institutions, if even we were
not disposed to seek their fountain-head in the sacred
gloom of the remotest antiquity. Whatever it be,
in any case, it will no more be said, that the Dabistán
<a name="Page_cxxiv" id="Page_cxxiv"></a><span class="pageno">cxxiv</span>
 was written “with the intention to claim for
Persia the pre-eminence over India, concerning
the antiquity of religious revelations.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_157" id="fnanchor_157"></a><a href="#footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></span> In
fact, Mohsan Fani never explicitly alludes to a comparative
antiquity between the Persians and Indians,
and implicitly acknowledges the anteriority of the
Indian religion over the Zoroastrian, in a part of
Persia at least, by relating that Gushtasp was converted
from the former to the latter by Zardusht,
by whom also the Indian sage, <span class="person">Sankhara atcharya</span>,
was vanquished.</p>

<p>After a more accurate examination, the resemblance
between the said religions will be found to
exist certainly in particular principles and tenets,
but not at all in the general character or the spirit
of these religious systems. Nothing can be more
dissimilar than the austerity of Mezdaism and the
luxuriancy of Hinduism in the development of their
respective dogmas, and particularly in their worship,
as was already observed.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_158" id="fnanchor_158"></a><a href="#footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></span>
We cannot however
deny, that not a little of the similarity in the
account of different religions belongs to the author
of the Dabistán, who most naturally confounded the
ideas of his own with those of more ancient times,
and used expressions proper to his particular creed
when speaking of that of others. Thus he employs
<a name="Page_cxxv" id="Page_cxxv"></a><span class="pageno">cxxv</span>
very often the term <dfn>angels</dfn> for that of divinities, and
carries the mania of allegorising, so peculiar to
the later Muhammedan Súfis, into his description
of the Indian mythology. This sort of substitution,
or these anachronisms of expression, are to be
remarked in the narrative of other authors, praised
for general correctness and veracity; I can here so
much the more readily call to mind similar inaccuracies
in the accounts which Greek historians, and
in particular the philosophic Xenophon, gave of
Persia, as I may add, that in many points they agree
with our Mohsan Fani.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><abbr title="Section Six">§ VI.</abbr>&mdash;<span class="sc">The
Religion of the Tabitian (Tibetans).</span></p>

<p>The third chapter of the Dabistán treats of the
religion of the <span class="title">Kera Tabitán</span> (Tibitans). The author
says that he received his information from a learned
man of this sect by means of an interpreter, who
did not always satisfy his inquiries; the little he
says appears to belong to a class of Buddhistic Hinduism,
and not to be destitute of truth.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p class="p2 center"><abbr title="Section Seven">§ VII.</abbr>&mdash;<span class="sc">The
Religion of the Jews.</span></p>

<p>Then follows, in the fourth chapter, a short
account of the religion of the Yahuds or Jews. The
author derived his notion from a Rabbin converted
<a name="Page_cxxvi" id="Page_cxxvi"></a><span class="pageno">cxxvi</span>
to Muhammedism, and states nothing which was
not really professed by one of the Jewish sects,
which, in his summary narration, he does not distinguish.
He gives a Persian translation of the first
five chapters, and a part of the sixth chapter of the
Genesis from the Hebrew original; a comparison of
it with several other translations known in Europe,
proves its general accuracy; I thought it not altother
unimportant to point out the few variations
which occur.</p>
</div><!--end chapter-->

<div class="chapter">
<p class="p2 center"><abbr title="Section Eight">§ VIII.</abbr>&mdash;<span class="sc">The
Religion of the Christians.</span></p>

<p>It is not without great interest that an European
Christian will peruse the fifth chapter, in which a
Persian treats of the religion of the <dfn>Tarsas</dfn>, that is,
“Christians.” Mohsan Fani declares, that he saw
several learned Christians, such as the Padre
<span class="person">Francis</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_159" id="fnanchor_159"></a><a href="#footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></span>
highly esteemed by the Portuguese in Goa and in
Surat. We can scarce doubt, that it was from that
<a name="Page_cxxvii" id="Page_cxxvii"></a><span class="pageno">cxxvii</span>
father, or some other Roman Catholic missionary,
that he received his information; as he portrays particularly
the Roman Catholic doctrine, of which, in
my opinion, he exhibits a more faithful idea than
that which a great number of Protestants entertain,
and are wont to express.</p>

<p>Every Christian may be satisfied with the picture
of his religion, which, although contracted in a
small compass, is nevertheless faithfully drawn by
a foreign but impartial hand. Mohsan Fani, in seventeen
pages of our translation, states only a few
circumstances of the life of Jesus Christ, and a few
dogmas relative to him as son of God, and the second
person of the holy Trinity. In the account of seven
sacraments, the eucharist is characterised in a manner
which will not fail to attract attention.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_160" id="fnanchor_160"></a><a href="#footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></span> Scarce
any rites or ceremonies are mentioned; the greatest
part of the statement relates to the moral precepts
of Christianity, which presents an advantageous
contrast with the many absurd and superstitious
duties, with which other religions are encumbered.
Thus, we find confirmed in the Dabistán that the
<a name="Page_cxxviii" id="Page_cxxviii"></a><span class="pageno">cxxviii</span>
Pentateuch of the Jews and the Gospel of the Christians
were both sufficiently familiar to Muhammedans
who had any pretension to learning.</p>

<p class="p2 footnote"> <a name="footnote_159" id="footnote_159"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_159"><span class="muchsmaller">[159]</span></a>
 Probably a Portuguese. From him Mohsan Fani might have received
the information (see <abbr title="volume two page">vol. II. p.</abbr> 307) that an image of St. Veronica is
preserved in a town of Spain, probably within the year 1641, before it
was known in India that Portugal had freed itself from the domination
of Spain, which event took place on the 1st December, 1640. On that
account, the father spoke of the peninsular sovereign as still possessor of
both kingdoms, and, instead of calling him <span class="title">king of Spain</span>, styled him
<span class="title">king of Portugal</span>, from fond partiality for his native country. This
remark was suggested to me by the learned viscount of Santarem.&mdash;(See
<abbr title="Volume Two pages">Vol. II. pp.</abbr> 307. 308, note 1.)</p>

 See <abbr title="volume two page">vol. II. p.</abbr> 315. “The holiest of all the sacraments, as it presents
the Lord Jesus under the form of bread, that it may become the
power of the soul.” This definition was most likely not that which
Mohsan Fani heard from father Francis, but the intelligent Persian
might have understood that a strong and lively representation of an
object is equivalent to its <em>real presence</em>, which latter words must have
been those used, as orthodox, by a Roman Catholic priest.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p class="p2 center"><abbr title="Section Nine">§ IX.</abbr>&mdash;<span class="sc">The Religion of the Muselmans.</span></p>

<p>The author of the Dabistán, after having treated
of the most ancient religions, passes to the comparatively
modern religious system of Arabia. The
Arabians, although frequently attacked, were never
conquered by the Assyrians, Medians, Persians, or
Romans; they maintained their political independance,
but could not avoid nor resist the religious
influence of nations with whom they were, during
ages, in various relations. The ancient history of
Arabia is lost, like that of many other nations; so
much is known of their oldest religion, that it resembled
that of the Persians and Hindus: it was the
Magism or Sabæism; the stars were worshipped as
idols from the remotest times; we read of antediluvian
idols. At the time, which we now consider,
that is the seventh century of our era, all the then
existing religions seemed to be far remote from
their original simplicity and purity;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_161" id="fnanchor_161"></a><a href="#footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></span>
idolatry was
dominant, and Monotheism preserved and positively
professed only in Judaism and Christianity, although
<a name="Page_cxxix" id="Page_cxxix"></a><span class="pageno">cxxix</span>
likewise corrupted by various kinds of superstition.
Followers of both these religions were settled in
Arabia, to which region the Jews fled from the
cruel destruction of their country by the Romans;
and the Christians, on account of the persecutions
and disorders which had arisen in the Eastern
church.</p>

<p>We see by what facts, circumstances, and notions
Muhammed was acted upon, whilst nourishing
his religious enthusiasm by solitary contemplation
in the cavern of mount Hara, to which he was
wont to retire for one month in every year. In his
fortieth year, at the same age at which Zoroaster
began to teach 600 years before Christ (according
to some chronologers), Muhammed, as many years
after the Messiah, assumed the prophetic mission
to reform the Arabians. He felt the necessity of
seizing some safe and essential dogmas in the chaos
of Magian, Zoroastrian, Jewish, and Christian notions;
broke all the figures of planets in the temple
of Mecca, and declared the most violent war against
all plastic, graven, and painted idols; he left undisturbed
only the <em>black stone</em>, Saturn’s emblem before,
and at the time when the Jewish traditions claimed
it for Abraham, and even transported it to heaven.
Muhammed preferred the latter to the more ancient
superstition; as to the rest, he abhorred the prevailing
idolatry of the Sabaians; and blamed the corruption
<a name="Page_cxxx" id="Page_cxxx"></a><span class="pageno">cxxx</span>
of monotheism in the Jews and Christians.
He felt in himself the powerful spirit, and undertook
to re-establish the <dfn>Touhid</dfn>, “the unity and spiritualism
of God;” he preached with enthusiastic
zeal the <span class="title">Islam</span>, “devotedness und resignation to
God.”</p>

<p>But, in order to found and to expand the great
and necessary truths, he knew no other means, but
to attach the believers to his own person, and to accustom
them to blind obedience to his dictates; he
proclaimed: “There is no God but God, and Muhammed
is his prophet;” he gave them the Koran,
the only holy book, in which his precepts were as
many commands proclaimed under the penalty of
eternal damnation. In the Muhammedan all spontaneity
is stifled; all desire, all attempt to be self-convinced
is interdicted; every thing becomes exterior,
the religious and civil Code but one.</p>

<p>Muhammed seemed not to know that religion
cannot be the gift, as it is not the property, of any
single man; it belongs to mankind. Any particular
creed lives only by its inherent force, independently
of the founder, who retires and leaves nothing behind
him but his name as a mere distinction from
that of another religion. Every individual action
is of little avail, if it does not proceed from the
free and pure impulse of the spirit, which must revive
in all succeeding generations. This is acknowledged
<a name="Page_cxxxi" id="Page_cxxxi"></a><span class="pageno">cxxxi</span>
in the Dabistán<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_162" id="fnanchor_162"></a><a href="#footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></span>
by giving a very philosophic
explanation of the expression <dfn>prophetic seal</dfn>,
or “the last of prophets:” “That which is reared
up by superior wisdom, renders the prophet’s
knowledge vain, and takes his color; that is to
say: if one hundred thousand prophets like himself
realise in themselves the person of superior
wisdom, they are possessors of the seal, the last
prophets, because it is superior wisdom which is
the seal, and they know themselves to be <em>effaced</em>,
and superior wisdom existing.” Muhammed, although
wise enough to connect himself with other
prophets, his predecessors, pretended however to
close the series, and to be the last of prophets, or
“the seal of prophetism.”</p>

<p>Vain project! immediately after him violent
contests arose,</p>

</div><!--end poem-->

<p>Thirty years after his death his family was dispossessed
of the Khalifat. This passed to the Moaviyahs,
who, residing in Damascus, kept it during
90 years, and then ceded it to the Abbasides, who
established their seat at Baghdad. The impulse
and development of the Islam was overwhelming
during the one hundred and twenty years
after the prophet’s death; the mighty spirit of conquest
<a name="Page_cxxxii" id="Page_cxxxii"></a><span class="pageno">cxxxii</span>
had arisen and was&mdash;I shall not say irresistible&mdash;but
certainly badly resisted by the nations assailed.
The Romans and Persians were then hard pressed
themselves; on the West by the Goths, on the East by
the Huns:&mdash;whilst the Greeks had sunk into general
luxury and degeneracy; all feebly sustained the
attack of hardy and active men, whose native habit
of rapine and devastation was then exalted and
sanctified by the name of religion, and continually
invigorated by rich, splendid, and easy conquests.
Thus, the khalifs, who were divided into two great
lines, the before-mentioned <span class="title">Abbasides</span>
and the <span class="title">Fatimites</span>,
extended their empire within 600 years after
Muhammed, not only over the greatest part of Asia,
but also along the western shore of Africa, Egypt,
Spain, and Sicily; threatening the rest of Europe.</p>

<p>After the first labors, came rest, during which
the genius of the Arabs turned to persevering study,
deep speculation, and noble ambition: this was the
scientific age of the Arabs, which began in the middle
of our eighth century, and was most conspicuous
in the old seats of learning, Babylonia, Syria,
Egypt, Persia, and India. But in the numerous
schools rose violent schisms and bloody contests
between philosophy and religion. In the mean
time the khalifs, by becoming worldly sovereigns,
had lost their sacred character, and were in contradiction
with the principle of their origin. The
<a name="Page_cxxxiii" id="Page_cxxxiii"></a><span class="pageno">cxxxiii</span>
crusades of the Christians, by reviving their martial
energy, maintained for some time the vacillating
power of the Khalifs, but their vast and divided
empire, assailed by Pagan nations, first in the West
in 1211, and forty-seven years afterwards in the
East, fell in 1258 of our era. Muhammedism
however revived in the barbarous and energetic
conquerors, Turks, Seljuks, Albanese, Kurds, Africans,
who were drawn into its circle; and science
was again cultivated in Tunis, Bulgaria, and India.</p>

<p>I thought necessary to draw this rapid historical
sketch, because within its outlines is contained the
account of the Muhammedan sects as given in the
text of the Dabistán.</p>

<p>Mohsan Fani himself lived in the age of general
decline of Muhammedism. He exhibits in the sixth
chapter the religion of his own nation: we may
expect that he will be true and accurate. He divides
the chapter into two sections: the first treats
of the creed of the Sonnites; the second, of that of
the Shiâhs. These are the two principal sects of the
Muhammedans, but divided into a number of others,
exceeding that of seventy-three, which Muhammed
himself has announced, and consigned, all except
one, to eternal damnation. This one was that of
the <dfn>sonnah</dfn> “the traditional law,” or <dfn>Jamaât</dfn>, “the
assembly.” The Dabistán explains this religion
in a manner which, to Muhammedans, might appear
<a name="Page_cxxxiv" id="Page_cxxxiv"></a><span class="pageno">cxxxiv</span>
sufficiently clear, in spite of digressions and
want of order in the arrangement of the matter;
but an European reader will desire more light than
is afforded in the text, and feel himself perplexed
to understand the meaning of frequent technical
terms, and to connect the various notions disseminated
in an unequal narrative&mdash;now too diffuse, now
too contracted. The following are the principal
features of the long account of Muhammedism contained
in the Dabistán.</p>

<p>Immediately after the promulgation of the Koran,
which followed Muhammed’s death, it became necessary
to fix the meaning and to determine the
bearing of its text. There was one theme in which
all agreed: the grandeur, majesty, and beneficence
of one supreme Being, the Creator, ruler, and preserver
of the world, which is the effulgence of his
power. This is expressed in the Koran in such a
strain of sublimity as may unite men of all religions
in one feeling of admiration. This excellence is an
inheritance of the most ancient Asiatic religion.
God can but be always the object of boundless
adoration, but never that of human reasoning.
Hence the Muhammedan sects disagreed about the
attributes of God.</p>

<p>The residence assigned, although inconsistently
with pure spiritualism, to the supreme Being was
the ninth heaven; an eighth sphere formed the intermediate
<a name="Page_cxxxv" id="Page_cxxxv"></a><span class="pageno">cxxxv</span>
story between the uppermost heaven
and seven other spheres, distributed among so many
prophets, in the same manner as, in the Desátir, the
seven prophet kings of the Péshdadian dynasty
were joined to the seven planets which they, each
one in particular, venerated. Numberless angels,
among whom four principal chiefs, fill the universe,
and serve, in a thousand different ways, the supreme
Lord of creation. We recognisee the notions
of the ancient Persian religion in this, and in the
whole system of divine government.</p>

<p>Another subject of violent and interminable dispute
was God’s action upon the nether world, principally
upon mankind, or God’s universal and eternal
judgment, commonly called <dfn>predestination</dfn>. This
subject was greatly agitated by the <span class="person">Matezalas</span>, <span class="person">Kadarians</span>,
<span class="person">Jabarians</span>, and others; they disputed</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">

  <div class="i0"><cite>And found no end, in wand’ring mazes lost.</cite>”</div>
 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>Although this subject appears to be connected
with the Zoroastrian doctrine of the two principles,
“good and bad,” yet it has never been agitated
with so much violence in so many particular ways by
any religionists as by the Muhammedans.</p>

<p>It has already been observed that, according
to tradition, the ancient Persian philosophy was
<a name="Page_cxxxvi" id="Page_cxxxvi"></a><span class="pageno">cxxxvi</span>
carried in the reign of Alexander to Greece, and
from thence, after having been recast in the mould
of Greek genius, returned in translations to its original
country. We find it expressly stated in the
Dabistán, that Plato and Aristotle were acknowledge
as the founders of two principal schools of
Muhammedan philosophers, to wit, those of the
<span class="title">Hukma ashrákín</span>, “Platonists,” and the <span class="title">Hukma masháyín</span>,
“Aristotelian, or Peripatetics.” To these add
the Súfí’s <span class="title">matsherâin</span>, “orthodox Sufis,” who took
care not to maintain any thing contrary to revelation,
and exerted all their sagacity to reconcile
passages of the Koran with sound philosophy.
This was the particular profession of the <dfn>Matkalmin</dfn>,
“scholastics.” These cede to no other philosophers
the palm of mastering subtilties and acute distinctions.
They had originally no other object but
that of defending their creed against the heterodox
philosophers. But they went further, and attacked
the Peripatetics themselves with the intention to
substitute another philosophy for theirs. It may be
here sufficient to call to mind the works of three
most celebrated men, <span class="person">Alfarabi</span>, <span class="person">Ibn Sina</span> (Avisenna),
and <span class="person">Ghazali</span>, whose works are reckoned to be the
best specimens of Arabian and Muhammedan
philosophy.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_163" id="fnanchor_163"></a><a href="#footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></span>
They contain three essential parts of orthodox
<a name="Page_cxxxvii" id="Page_cxxxvii"></a><span class="pageno">cxxxvii</span>
dogmatism: 1. <span class="title">ontology</span>, <span class="title">physiology</span>, and <span class="title">psychology</span>;
these together are called “the science of
possible things;” 2. <dfn>theology</dfn>, that is, the discussion
upon the existence, essence, and the attributes
of God; as well as his relations with the world and
man in particular; 3. <dfn>the science of prophetism</dfn>, or
“revealed theology.” All these subjects are touched
upon in the Dabistán, but in a very desultory
manner. I shall add, that the author puts in evidence
a sect called <span class="title">Akhbárín</span>, or “dogmatic traditionists,”
who participate greatly in the doctrine
of the Matkalmin, and in his opinion are the most
approvable of all religious philosophers.</p>

<p>The contest for the khalifat between the family of
Ali, Muhammed’s son-in-law, and the three first
khalifs, as well as the families of Moaviah and Abbas,
a contest which began in the seventh century,
and appears not yet terminated in our days&mdash;this
contest, so much more violent as it was at once
religious and political, occasioned the rise of a
great number of sects. Much is found about Ali
in the Dabistán, and even an article of the
Koran,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_164" id="fnanchor_164"></a><a href="#footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></span>
published no where else relative to this great Muselman,
which his adversaries are said to have suppressed.
The adherents of Ali are called <span class="title">Shiâhs</span>.</p>

<p><a name="Page_cxxxviii" id="Page_cxxxviii"></a><span class="pageno">cxxxviii</span>
The Persians, after being conquered by the Arabs,
were compelled to adopt the Muhammedan religion,
but they preserved a secret adherence to Magism,
their ancient national creed, they were therefore
easily disposed to join any sect, which was more
or less contrary to the standard creed of their conquerors,
and bore some slight conformity, or had
the least connection with, their former religion.
They became Shiâhs.</p>

<p>Among these sectaries originated the particular
office of <span class="title">Imám</span>, whose power partook of something
of a mysterious nature: the visible presence
of an Imám was not required; he could, although
concealed, be acknowledged, direct and command
his believers; his name was <span class="person">Mahdi</span>, “the director.”
This opinion originated and was spread
after the sudden disappearance of the seventh Imám,
called <span class="person">Ismâil</span>. His followers, the Ismâilahs, maintained
that he was not dead; that he lived concealed,
and directed the faithful by messages, sent by
him, and brought by his deputies; that he would one
day reappear, give the victory to his adherents over
all other sects, and unite the world in one religion.
More than one Mahdi was subsequently proclaimed in
different parts of Asia, Africa, and Europe&mdash;always
expected, never appearing&mdash;so that it became a proverbial
expression among the Arabs to denote tardiness:
“<cite>as slow as a Mahdi</cite>.” We recognize in this
<a name="Page_cxxxix" id="Page_cxxxix"></a><span class="pageno">cxxxix</span>
an ancient idea of Zoroaster: he too was to reappear
in his sons at the end of 12,000 years; rather late,&mdash;but
mankind never tire of hope and expectation.</p>

<p>A creed, like that of the <span class="title">Ismâilahs</span>, because founded
upon something mysterious, vague, and spiritual,
was likely to branch out in most extraordinary conceptions
and practices. The Dabistán abounds with
curious details about them. Their doctrine bore
the character of duplicity: one part was manifest,
the other concealed. Their manner of making proselytes
was not open; they acted in the dark. They
first induced the neophyte to doubt, then to despise
his own creed, and at last to exchange it for apparently
more sublime truths, until, after having sufficiently
emboldened his reasoning faculty, they
enabled him to throw off every restraint of authority
in religious matters. We see in the
Dabistán,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_165" id="fnanchor_165"></a><a href="#footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></span>
the degrees through which an Ismâilah was to pass
until he believed in no religion at all.</p>

<p>A most remarkable sect of the Ismâilahs was that
of the <span class="title">Almutians</span>, so called from <dfn>Alamut</dfn>, a hill-fort in
the Persian province of <span class="place">Ghilan</span>. This fort was the
seat of <span class="person">Hassan</span>, a self-created Imám, and became the
capital of an empire, perhaps unique in the history
of the world.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_166" id="fnanchor_166"></a><a href="#footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></span>
An Imám, called by Europeans “the
old man of the mountain,” without armies, or
<a name="Page_cxl" id="Page_cxl"></a><span class="pageno">cxl</span>
treasures, commanded the country around, and terrified
a great part of Asia by a band of devoted adherents,
whom he sent about to propagate his religion,
and to execute his commands, which were
frequently the murder of his enemies. The executioners
were unknown save at the fatal moment
of action; mighty khalifs and sultans met with
their murderers among their most intimate servants,
or the guardians of their doors, in the midst of
crowded public places or in the solitude of their secret
bed-chambers. The <span class="title">Fedayis</span>, so were they called,
devoted themselves not only to the sacred service of
their Imám, but hired their arm also for profane
service to foreign chiefs, such as the Christian crusaders.
Among Europeans, these Ismâilahs were
known under the name of <span class="title">Assassins</span>, which well
answered their infamous profession, but is better
derived from <dfn>Hashishah</dfn><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_167" id="fnanchor_167"></a><a href="#footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></span>,
a sort of hemp, from which
they extracted an intoxicating beverage for their
frequent use. During one hundred and sixty years
the Ismâilahs were the terror of the weak and the
mighty, until they fell in one promiscuous slaughter,
with the khalif of Islámism, under the swords of the
ferocious invaders who, issuing from the vast steppes
of Tartary, fell upon the disordered empire of the
Muhammedans.</p>

<p><a name="Page_cxli" id="Page_cxli"></a><span class="pageno">cxli</span>
The Ismâilahs, and other sects connected with
them, professed a great attachment to an Imám,
whose lineage was always traced up to Ali through
a series of intermediate descendants; but it belonged
to the <span class="title">Ali-Ilahians</span> to deify Ali himself, or to believe
his having been an incarnation of God.</p>

<p>Another sect, the <span class="title">Ulviahs</span>, also devoted to Ali,
maintain that he was united with the sun, that he
is now the sun, and having also been the sun before,
he was for some days only united to an elemental
body. Both these sects reject the Koran.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p class="p2 center"><abbr title="Section Ten">§ X.</abbr>&mdash;<span class="sc">The Religion of the Sadikiahs.</span></p>

<p>The third volume of this work begins with the
seventh chapter, upon the religion of the <span class="title">Sadikiahs</span>.
It is generally known that, during the life of Muhammed,
another prophet, called Musaylima, arose in
the country of Yamáma, and dared offer to himself
in a letter to the former as a partner of his sacred
mission, but was treated as a liar. He had however
gained a great number of followers, at the head of
whom he was defeated and himself slain in a bloody
battle against Khaled, a general of the first Khalif,
the very same year as Muhammed’s death. We
<a name="Page_cxlii" id="Page_cxlii"></a><span class="pageno">cxlii</span>
find in the Dabistán, what appears less generally
known, that Musaylima’s sect, far from being entirely
crushed after his fall, existed under the name of
<span class="title">Sadikias</span> in the seventeenth century of our era, and
conformed to a second <dfn>Faruk</dfn>, or Koran, to which
they attributed a divine origin, and a greater authority
than to the
first.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_168" id="fnanchor_168"></a><a href="#footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>Another account, not frequently met with, is
contained in the eighth chapter of the Dabistán, concerning
<span class="person">Vahed Mahmud</span>, who appeared in the beginning
of our thirteenth century, and is by his adherents
placed above Muhammed and Ali. Among
his tenets and opinions is to be remarked that of an
ascending refinement or perfection of elemental matter,
from the brute or mineral to that of a vegetable
form; from this to that of an animal body; and
thence progressing to that of Mahmud.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_169" id="fnanchor_169"></a><a href="#footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></span>
Further,
the particular mode of transmigration of souls by
means of food into which men, after their death, are
changed; such food, <em>in which intelligence and action
may reside</em>, becomes continually the aliment and
<a name="Page_cxliii" id="Page_cxliii"></a><span class="pageno">cxliii</span>
substance of new successive human beings. We
were not a little astonished to find these singular opinions
agreeing with the information, which Milton’s
archangel Raphael imparts to Adam, the father of
mankind.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_170" id="fnanchor_170"></a><a href="#footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>This sort of hylozoism is more expanded in a
particular system of cosmogony of the same
Vahed,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_171" id="fnanchor_171"></a><a href="#footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></span>
according to which the materials of the world existed
from the very beginning, which signifies from the
first appearance of <dfn>afrad</dfn>, “rudimental units.” We
<a name="Page_cxliv" id="Page_cxliv"></a><span class="pageno">cxliv</span>
can never think meanly of this opinion, when we
find it coinciding with that of <span class="person">Leibnitz</span> in our seventeenth
century, contemporary of Mohsan Fani.
According to the celebrated German
philosopher,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_172" id="fnanchor_172"></a><a href="#footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></span>
there exists already an entirely organical preformation
in the seeds of the bodies which are born, and
all souls had always pre-existed in some sort of organized
body, and shall after death remain united
with an organic whole; because in the order of nature
souls are not likely to exist entirely separated
from any kind of body. In the eighteenth century
<span class="person">Bonnet</span>, a great physiologist,
maintained,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_173" id="fnanchor_173"></a><a href="#footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></span> that all
was preformed from the beginning, nothing engendered;
all organized bodies were pre-existing in a
very small compass in the germs, in which souls
may also pre-exist, these indestructible germs may
sojourn in such or such a body until the moment of
its decomposition, then pass, without the least alteration,
into another body, from this into a third,
and so on; each of the germs incloses another imperishable
germ, which will be developed but in a
future state of our planet, which is destined to experience
a new revolution.</p>

<p>We see here the very same ideas, without any
<a name="Page_cxlv" id="Page_cxlv"></a><span class="pageno">cxlv</span>
mutual communication, entertained in the East and
the West, in ancient and modern times.</p>

<p>Vahed Mahmud combines his cosmogony with
periods of 8000 years, eight of which form a great
cycle of 64,000 years, at the completion of which
the world is renovated. This sect is said to have
been widely spread in the world; in Persia the persecution
of Shah Abbas forced them to lie concealed.</p>

 The Druids, among the ancient Britons, believed the progressive
ascent of the soul, beginning with the meanest insect, and arriving through
various orders of existence at its human stage. The soul, according to
its choice during terrestrial life, progressed, even after death, in good
and happiness, or evil and misery; the virtuous could return to earth
and become prophets among mankind: in which belief the ancient Britons
agreed with the Indian Buddhists.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><abbr title="Section Eleven">§ XI.</abbr>&mdash;<span class="sc">The
 Religion of the Roshenians.</span></p>

<p>The ninth chapter of the Dabistán introduces
to us <span class="person">Mian Báyezid</span>, who, born in the Panjáb, flourished
in the middle of the sixteenth century under
the reign of Humayún, the Emperor of India. At
first a strict observer of Muhammedism, he abandoned
afterwards the exterior practices of this religion,
and, devoting his mind to contemplation, assumed
with the character of a saint the title of a
“master of light;” his followers were called <dfn>Roshenians</dfn>,
or “enlightened.” His sayings, several of
which are quoted in the Dabistán, express sound
reason, pure morality, and fervent piety. In the
spirit of his nation and time, and for self-defence,
he took up arms against the Moghuls. His history
and that of his sons is carried to the middle of the
seventeenth century, the time of Mohsan Fani.</p>

<p><a name="Page_cxlvi" id="Page_cxlvi"></a><span class="pageno">cxlvi</span>
Muhammed was the permanent type of a prophet,
in whom the religious and political character
were united. The first Khalifs were all military
chiefs and religious men; the Koran furnished the
rules of foreign and internal policy, the final decision
of every tribunal, the inciting exclamation to
combat and carnage, and a prayer for every occasion.
The founders of sects were frequently warriors,
or, what in Asia is generally the same, highwaymen
and plunderers of caravans; such was the
just mentioned Miyan Bayezid, and many others.
As possessors of empires, they preserved the austere
habits of ascetics: they carried a sabre and a rosary,
counted their beads and gave order for battle; emaciated
by fasts, covered with a woollen mantle, sitting
upon the bare ground, they disposed of empires
and received the homage of millions of men.</p>

<p>The Mohammedans preserved their religion, as
long as they were militant: because all states of
mental excitement are apt to support each other.
But, in solitary retirement, and in the precincts of
schools, the doctrine of Muhammed was put to the
test of reason: now began the struggle between
religion and philosophy. Fearful to part at once
with early impressions and national feelings, attempts
to reconcile faith and reason were made;
religious philosophers had recourse to allegory, in
order to rationalize strange and absurd dogmas and
<a name="Page_cxlvii" id="Page_cxlvii"></a><span class="pageno">cxlvii</span>
practices; for the literal they substituted a mystical
sense; under arbitrary acceptations and interpretations,
the foundation of the doctrine itself disappeared,
or was confounded with some old dogma
renewed, if not one entirely invented: in short, the
Muhammedan religion appeared to have survived
itself; its presumed period of one thousand years
was believed to be completed under the reign of
Akbar.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p class="p2 center"><abbr title="Section Twelve">§ XII.</abbr>&mdash;<span class="sc">The
 Religion of the Ilahiahs.</span></p>

<p>Akbar was the greatest among the Moghul emperors
of India. He began in his fourteenth year a
reign environed by war and rebellion. After having
vanquished all his enemies and established peace and
security around him, he turned his attention to religion.
He soon found it right to grant unlimited
toleration to all religions in his empire. Called the
“shade of God,” he took the resolution to realise in
himself the otherwise vain title bestowed by slavish
flattery upon all sovereigns of Asia, and to imitate,
according to his faculties, him who bestows the
blessings of his merciful providence on all creatures
without distinction. This he declared to his
fanatic son Jehangir, who did not conceal his discontent
about the building of an Hindu temple in
<a name="Page_cxlviii" id="Page_cxlviii"></a><span class="pageno">cxlviii</span>
Benares: “Are not,” said Akbar, “five-sixths of
all mankind either Hindus or unbelievers? If
I were actuated by motives similar to those which
thou ownest, what would remain to me but to
destroy them all?”</p>

<p>The inquisitive emperor was acquainted with the
religious history of the Persian empire; he surrounded
himself with men of all religions&mdash;Muhammedans
of all sects, Hindus, Jews, and Christians,
as well as with philosophers free from superstition;
he liked to question them all, and to encourage
public polemical discussions in his presence. The
Sonnites and Shiâhs reviled reciprocally the chief
personages of their adherence, the three first khalifs
and Ali; Muhammed himself was not more
spared than his companions and successors. The
errors of their doctrine, the vices of their character,
and the irregularities of their conduct were freely
exposed, severely blamed, and wittily ridiculed.
If Muhammedism was treated in such a manner,
other religions could not claim more indulgence.
The dramatic form, which Mohsan Fani gives to
the religious controversies, is certainly curious; we
can scarce suppose his having known the dialogues
of Lucian, nor is it in the least probable that a late
French author ever saw the Dabistán and took from
this book the idea of the twenty-first chapter of his
celebrated work, entitled “Problem of religious
<a name="Page_cxlix" id="Page_cxlix"></a><span class="pageno">cxlix</span>
“contradictions.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_174" id="fnanchor_174"></a><a href="#footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></span>
The object aimed at by these
three authors was the same; but their compositions
differ from each other as much as the genius and
character of the Greeks, French, and Persians, in
whose language each of them respectively wrote.
In whatsoever point Mohsan Fani may yield to the
Greco-Syrian, or to the French author, he, certainly,
I will venture to say, equals them in force,
boldness, and sincerity; and perhaps surpasses either
in pointed application of truth. His objections are
not vague attempts of witticism with the intention
to ridicule: they are special and serious, directed
to real and patent falsehood or prejudice; he does
not fence with imaginary shadowy adversaries, but
he strikes a present and tangible foe; his style, never
tainted by affectation, is plain and blunt, such
as becomes a reformer combating popular superstition.
The controversies, the scene of which is
placed before the throne, or rather tribunal, of Akbar,
obtain the imperial sanction: Muhammedism
is condemned.</p>

<p>Indeed, the emperor abrogated several practices
of that religion to which he had been devoted
in his first years; he confined the cultivation
of science, as taken from the Arabs, to astronomy,
geography, medicine, and philosophy, and
<a name="Page_cl" id="Page_cl"></a><span class="pageno">cl</span>
wished to prevent the waste of life in futile and
useless studies. At last, in the month of December,
A. D. 1579, twenty-six years before his death, he substituted
for the common profession of the Muhammedans
the new: “<cite>There is no God but God, and
Akbar his khalif</cite> (or deputy).” He received from a
great number of Amirs and distinguished persons
the voluntary agreement and consent to four conditions,
namely, the sacrifice of property, life, reputation,
and religion, by entering into the new religious
pact, called <dfn>Ilahi</dfn>, “divine.” Moreover, he
introduced in lieu of the former, a new era, to begin
from the death of his father Huinayún, that is
from the year of the Hejira 963, (A. D. 1555): it
was to be called <dfn>Ilahi</dfn>; the months were regulated
according to the mode of Irán, and fourteen festivals
established in concordance with those of Zoroaster’s
religion. It was to this ancient Persian
creed, that he gave the preference, having been
instructed in its sacred tenets and practices by a
learned fire-worshipper who had joined him; and
from books which were sent to him from Persia
and Kirmán. He received the sacred fire, and
committed it to the faithful hands of <span class="person">Abu’l fazil</span>, his
confidential minister: the holy flames of Zardusht
blazed again upon the altars of <span class="title">Aria</span>, and, after a
separation of many centuries, Persians and Indians
were reunited in a common worship.</p>

<p><a name="Page_cli" id="Page_cli"></a><span class="pageno">cli</span>
As a proof of Akbar’s expansive mind, directed
to all subjects which may interest mankind, I shall
mention his having sequestered a number of children,
before they could speak, from all communition
with the rest of society, in order to know
whether they would form a language. After fourteen
years of seclusion, it was found that they were
dumb: “which made it evident,” says Mohsan
Fani, “that language and letters are not natural
to man&mdash;that language is of a long date and the
world very ancient.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_175" id="fnanchor_175"></a><a href="#footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>In the third section of the tenth chapter, the
author treats of the influences of the stars upon the
nether world, a very ancient superstition, common
to most nations. Every master of fame is said to
have worshipped particularly one of the stars; Akbar
also received divine commands with regard to
them. We find, in a digression of this section,
curious historical details respecting the person of
Jangis khan, his adoration of the celestial bodies,
epilepsy, and singular superstition of combs. The
great conqueror addressed to his sons the most
<a name="Page_clii" id="Page_clii"></a><span class="pageno">clii</span>
earnest admonitions to remain faithful to the religion
of the stars, to which their fortune was
attached; but fifty-three years after his death one of
his successors and a great part of his nation embraced
Muhammedism.</p>

<p>The fourth section of the tenth chapter contains
important information upon the administration of
India. Akbar was the first of the Moghul emperors
who considered India as his native country, and
directed his best efforts to the amelioration of its
condition. Exalted to the highest rank, not only
by his birth, but also by his personal acquirements;
assisted, besides, by a train of devoted and enlightened
servants, he could promise himself duration
of the new religion, which he had fondly labored
to found. In vain: it disappeared with him. Private
persons, camel-drivers, and robbers, emerging
from obscurity, such as Muhammed, and others
before and after that Arabian leader, effected more
than an emperor, with every possible advantage
united in and around his person! Human intellect
was perhaps then satiated with religion; its measure
was full: it could not receive any more. In fact,
after Muhammed a number of sects, but no new
religion, arose: in this sense he may, with some
appearance of truth, be called the last of prophets,
or the <dfn>Khátim</dfn>, “the seal of prophetism.”</p>

<p>Akbar died in 1605 A. D., eight or ten years
<a name="Page_cliii" id="Page_cliii"></a><span class="pageno">cliii</span>
before the birth of the author of the Dabistán. The
latter passed his youth and manhood in India, under
the reigns of that emperor’s son, Jehangir, and
grand-son, Shah Jehan, and great-grandson Aurengzeb;
and was in personal connection with the
latter’s brother, the religious Darashukoh. Mohsan
Fani had therefore good opportunities to be informed
of the events of their days. The religion of the
<span class="title">Ilahiahs</span> is properly the last of which he treats; for
what relates to the religions of the philosophers
and Súfis, the subjects of the two last chapters,
are rather selections of all creeds and opinions, than
particular religions. It will be remembered that
sir W. Jones supposed these two last chapters not
to have been written by the author of the rest of
the Dabistán, which I dare neither affirm nor
deny.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_176" id="fnanchor_176"></a><a href="#footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<p class="p2 center"><abbr title="Section Thirteen">§ XIII.</abbr>&mdash;<span class="sc">The
 Religion of the Philosophers.</span></p>

<p>In the eleventh chapter, entitled “Of the religion
of the Wise,” we find it repeated that Philosophers
were divided into two great classes: “the
Eastern and the Western.” The first are the
<span class="title">Hushangians</span>, teachers of the Greeks until the time of
Plato and Aristotle; it is believed that their philosophy,
<a name="Page_cliv" id="Page_cliv"></a><span class="pageno">cliv</span>
modified and refined, returned from Greece
to Asia, and was received by the Muhammedan
scholars to be adapted to their own creed. Then
took place a singular mixture and confusion of
Siderism, Judaism, Christianity, Muhammedism,
and all sorts of philosophic opinions. The cosmology
of the Hushangians was preserved. Seven
special prophets, Ismâil, Jesus, Joseph, Enoch,
Aaron, Moses, and Abraham, inhabit the seven
heavens,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_177" id="fnanchor_177"></a><a href="#footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></span>
to begin from that of the Moon, which is
the lowest, and rising upwards. If, in general,
ten spheres are assumed,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_178" id="fnanchor_178"></a><a href="#footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></span>
they are made the dwellings
of so many intelligences. These ideas, so
<a name="Page_clv" id="Page_clv"></a><span class="pageno">clv</span>
ancient, as we have seen, were not disowned by
eminent men in much later times. The great Kepler,
and after him Reaumur, believed that intelligences
or souls directed the movements of celestial
bodies. Philosophers, struck with the marvellous
order of nature, were adverse to admitting any
mechanism&mdash;the very name of which frightened
them; they therefore called all occult powers souls
or spirits. The same idea is adopted in morality:
whatever is praiseworthy is <dfn>angelic</dfn>, whatever blamable,
<dfn>satanic</dfn>. <cite>From goodness arises an angel; from
badness, a Satan</cite>: so said the prophet. Such simple
and truth-like ideas were either originally disguised
under the vest of fiction; or existing traditions of
various origin were afterwards more or less ingeniously
interpreted as allegories. Thus, the ordinary
names, expressions, tenets, traditions, and
practices of the Arabian prophet received symbolic,
allegoric, mystic interpretations. The <dfn>Kabah</dfn> (the
square temple of Mecca), the holy centre of a living,
circumambulating world, becomes an emblem of
the sun; its famous <dfn>black stone</dfn>, hollowed by the
kisses of the pious, represents Venus, the bright
star on the borders of heaven; <dfn>paradise</dfn>, its milk,
honey, wine, <dfn>Tuba</dfn> (tree of beatitude), <dfn>Hur</dfn> and <dfn>Kasur</dfn>
(nymphs and palaces) allude to intellectual delights;
<dfn>hell</dfn>, its <dfn>Zakum</dfn> (tree of nature), and torments, are
explained as unavoidable consequences of depravity.
<a name="Page_clvi" id="Page_clvi"></a><span class="pageno">clvi</span>
Such interpretations of the Muhammedans seem
often to be like their bridge <dfn>Sirat</dfn>, which connects
heaven and hell, <cite>sharp as a razor and thin as a
hair</cite>. <dfn>Transmigration</dfn>, or rather reproduction, is
admitted, although not easily reconciled with the
resurrection of the same body. <dfn>The blasts of the
trumpet</dfn>, and the whole scene of the resurrection lose
their materialism in a sort of rational allegory. <dfn>The
other world</dfn> is the destruction and renovation of nature
at the completion and renewal of great periods
of time, one of which comprised 360,000 solar
years. <dfn>Resurrection</dfn> is “the wakening from the
sleep of heedlessness;” whenever an intellect
attained that degree of perfection, it has returned
to its origin; it is restored to life; this indubitably
happens when nothing material exists: for, “where
there is no body, there is no death.”</p>

<p>After having treated in this way the great dogmas
of religion, the Muhammedan philosophers found it
not more difficult to rationalise every circumstance
respecting their prophet, he who obeyed the voice
of an invisible speaker. Did Muhammed really
<em>split the moon</em>? Not in the least&mdash;splitting is penetrating
from the exterior into the interior; the fissure
of the moon typifies nothing else but the renunciation
of the external for the internal, which is
“the superior wisdom;” who possessed it more
than the prophet (the peace of God be with him!)
<a name="Page_clvii" id="Page_clvii"></a><span class="pageno">clvii</span>
he, the master of the <em>lunar sphere</em>? This, with the
Orientals, is the seat of human intelligence and
perfection.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_179" id="fnanchor_179"></a><a href="#footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></span>
One of their greatest scholars, or as
they say “the learned of the world,” known to us
under the name of Avisenna, undertook to give a
reasonable account of Muhammed’s <em>ascent to heaven</em>,
and framed a wonderful romance of mystic spiritualism.
He terminates by explaining how the prophet,
after his return from such a journey, could
find his bed-clothes still warm: “He had travelled
with his mind, and when he had completed his
mental task, returned back to himself, and in less
than an eye’s twinkling recovered his former state;
whoever knows, understands why he went; and
whoever knows not, looks in vain for an explanation.”</p>

<p>We may, not without interest, observe the natural
process of the human mind in reviewing and reforming
conceptions, the original form of which is
not seldom entirely obliterated. The author of the
Dabistán does more than satiate the most inquisitive
<a name="Page_clviii" id="Page_clviii"></a><span class="pageno">clviii</span>
reader with allegoric, now and then very fanciful,
interpretations, which he continues, not without
repetitions of the same subjects, through the
subsequent chapter, upon which I am about to
touch. Mohsan Fani, here as elsewhere, fails not
to adduce several philosophers of more ancient as
well as of his own times. Among the latter is <span class="person">Hakim
Kamran</span>, whose free and sound opinions, about
the origin of societies and the prophets regulating
them, will be read with some interest; as will also
the account of the books which Kamran read and
explained, whence the state of literature of those
times may be inferred.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><abbr title="Section Fourteen">§ XIV.</abbr>&mdash;<span class="sc">The Religion of the Sufis.</span></p>

<p>We arrive at the last chapter, “<cite>Upon the Sufis</cite>;”
the most abstruse of the twelve, but to which we
are well enough prepared by the contents of the
former.</p>

<p>Súfism, according to the Dabistán, belongs to all
religions; its adherents are known, under different
names among the Hindus, Persians, and Arabians;
it appears to be nothing else but the rationalism of
any sort of doctrine. It could never be the religion
of a whole nation; it remained confined to the precincts
of schools and societies.</p>

<p><a name="Page_clix" id="Page_clix"></a><span class="pageno">clix</span>
In the work before us we find it stated, that the
belief of the pure Súfis was the same as that of the
Ashrakians (Platonists): we know what the Muhammedans
have made of it. According to the Imám
Koshairi, quoted by Jâmi,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_180" id="fnanchor_180"></a><a href="#footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></span>
the Muselmans, after
Muhammed’s death, distinguished the eminent men
among them by no other title but that of “the
companions of God’s apostle.” These were, in
the second generation, called <span class="title">Tábáyún</span>, “followers.”
Afterwards the Islamites were divided into divers
classes; those among them who particularly devoted
themselves to the practice of religion, were named
“servants of God,” which name was, after the rise
of numerous sects, claimed by some from among all
the different sectaries. It was then that the followers
of the orthodox doctrine, in order to preserve
the purity of their faith and the strength of their
piety, assumed the name of <span class="title">Súfis</span>, which name became
celebrated before the end of the second century
of the Hejira, that is, before the year 815 of
our era. We may believe one of the greatest scholars
of Muhammedism, <span class="person">Ghazáli</span>, who ranged himself
among the Súfis of his time towards the end of our
eleventh century, when he declares that in their
society he found rest in believing one God, the prophet,
<a name="Page_clx" id="Page_clx"></a><span class="pageno">clx</span>
and the last judgment: this is the faith of the
<span class="title">orthodox Súfis</span>.</p>

<p>The assumption of any particular name carries
men, who so distinguish and separate themselves
from their fellows, much further than they themselves
at first intended, particularly when the distinction
and separation are founded upon vague and
indeterminate notions of metaphysics. Under the
impression, that there are secrets upon which their
salvation depends, they will stretch reason and
imagination to penetrate them. The Súfis are
divided, according to their own
phraseology,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_181" id="fnanchor_181"></a><a href="#footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></span> into
three classes: “<dfn>the attracted</dfn>, <dfn>the travellers</dfn>,” and “<dfn>the
attracted travellers</dfn>;” the last of whom combine the
qualities of the two former. I will class them here,
with respect to their doctrine and manners, into
five orders.</p>

<p>1. The religious Súfis, in general, are occupied
with something beyond the limits of our natural
consciousness; they exercise to the utmost their
inward organ or inner sense, and acquire a philosophic
imagination<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="unindent">Such was the prophetic gift of Muhammed, and as
<a name="Page_clxi" id="Page_clxi"></a><span class="pageno">clxi</span>
long as they adhere to his sayings, they are <span class="title">the orthodox
Súfis</span>, whom I have already mentioned.</p>

<p>2. Another order endeavor to comprehend, to
fix, and to explain the attributes of God; the holy
object sanctifies their efforts; unattainable, it exalts
their souls above themselves; incomprehensibility
yields to the sacred power of self-intuition; mysterious
darkness to celestial light; their intellect, no
more terrestrial, “knows its own sun and its own
stars;”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_183" id="fnanchor_183"></a><a href="#footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></span>
by continual mental excitement they
produce in themselves (according to their own phraseology)
a state of intoxication; in the full enjoyment
of their liberty, they approach the Supreme
Being, and finally fancy an intimate union with their
Creator. These are the <span class="title">mystic Sufis</span>.</p>

<p>Man, to express his most fervent adoration of the
Divinity, uses the expressions by which he is wont
to address the object of his most tender affections;
he has but the fire of earth to kindle in sacrifice to
heaven; and to elevate his soul to the Supreme
Being, he makes wings of the most lively sentiments
which he ever experienced, and can excite in himself.
The intensity of inward feeling breaks loose
in outward demonstrations, gesture, song, and
dance<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Such in the poet’s eye is the dance of angels, but
less refined must be that of mortals, and really one
sort of it strangely contrasts with the usually grave
deportment of bearded ample-robed Muselmans,
from Muhammed, who gave the example, down to
the Durvishes of our days, who, with frantic
howls and vehement whirling motions, by ludicrous
and unseemly exhibition, destroy the whole gravity
of inward intention. Mohsan Fani adduces some
instances of dancing, and quotes throughout his
work verses of mystical poetry upon Divine love, in
glowing expressions belonging to profane passion.
It is known how equivocal in their meaning they
appear in the works of Jelal eddin Rumi, Sâdi, Hafiz,
and others.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_185" id="fnanchor_185"></a><a href="#footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>3. It was not always vehement enthusiasm which
was nourished in the contemplation of one Supreme
Being; mysticism, in Súfis of a milder character,
became <cite>quietism: he to whom all things are one, who
draweth all things to one, and seeth all things in one, may</cite>
<a name="Page_clxiii" id="Page_clxiii"></a><span class="pageno">clxiii</span>
<cite>enjoy peace and rest of spirit</cite>. I have quoted the words
of an English bishop, Jeremy Taylor, and might
borrow similar passages from a more ancient Christian
bishop, Synesius,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_186" id="fnanchor_186"></a><a href="#footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></span>
for expressing a sort of
purely <dfn>spiritual pantheism</dfn>. But there is another,
which seems not to exclude materialism: the great
cause from which the infinite series of all material
and spiritual existences originates, is enveloped, as
it were, with the vest of the universe; never known
as to its essence, but always felt in its manifestations;
it is</p>

<p>In short, God is all, and all is God. This appeared
not more incomprehensible, but less complicated
than any other system to the <dfn>pantheistical
Súfis</dfn>.</p>

<p>4. After excessive efforts to transcend the limits
of his nature, the philosophic inquirer re-enters
into himself, and coerces his futile attempts by the
precept: “Know thyself.” Having, as it were,
recovered himself, and feeling that every thing proceeds
from the depth of his mind, he sees himself
in every thing; heaven and earth are his own; “he
demands from himself whatever he wishes;” for
he is every thing; he finds the God whom he sought
<a name="Page_clxiv" id="Page_clxiv"></a><span class="pageno">clxiv</span>
in himself, in his own heart, and says, “Who
knows himself, knows God.” This is religious
psychology, the creed of the <dfn>egotist class of Súfis</dfn>.</p>

<p>It is a fact which appears incredible, but is too
well attested for the admission of a doubt, that Súfis
believed themselves to be gods, and adhered to their
belief, amid torments, until death.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_188" id="fnanchor_188"></a><a href="#footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></span>
This psychological
fact may be explained by considering that,
according to Súfism, God is nothing else but an
idea of the highest perfection; <cite>he</cite>, says our author,
<cite>from whose sight both worlds vanished, who in the steps
of right faith arrived at the rank of perfect purity, from
truth to truth, became God</cite>; that is, he became one
with his own idea of perfection, which cannot be
disputed to him; his divinity is an illusion, but nothing
else to him is the world; it is all and nothing,
dependent upon his own creation and annihilation.</p>

<p><abbr title="Five">V.</abbr> Transacting as it were directly with the Divine
Being, the Súfis throw off the shackles of the positive
religion; pious rebels, they neither fast nor
make pilgrimages to the temple of Mecca, nay, they
forget their prayers; for with God there is no other
but the soundless language of the heart. From
excess of religion they have no religion at all. Thus
is confirmed the trite saying that “extremes meet.”
“<cite>The perfection of a man’s state</cite>,” says Jami, “<cite>and the
utmost degree to which saints may attain, is to be without</cite>
<a name="Page_clxv" id="Page_clxv"></a><span class="pageno">clxv</span>
<cite>an attribute, and without a mark</cite>.” The most
fervent zeal sinks into the coldest indifference about
religion. The author of the Dabistán declares positively,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_189" id="fnanchor_189"></a><a href="#footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></span>
that “whoever says that the Muselmans
are above the Christians, does not know the true
Being.” But the whole creed of an <em>emancipated</em>
(this is the name I give to one belonging to the fifth
order of Súfis) uniting in himself the egotist, pantheistic,
and mystical Súfi will be found in the following
verses of Jelal-eddin Rúmi, before mentioned:</p>

<p class="blockquote"><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_190" id="fnanchor_190"></a><a href="#footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></span>“O
Moslims! what is to be done? I do not know myself;
I am neither Jew, nor Christian, nor Gueber, nor Moslim; I
am not from the East nor from the West; nor from land nor
sea; neither from the region of nature nor from that of heaven;
not from Hind nor China; not from Bulgaria nor
Irak, nor from the towns of Khorassan. I am neither
water nor dust, wind nor fire; not from the highest nor
deepest, neither self-existent nor created; I am not from
the two worlds, no son of Adam, not from hell nor from
heaven, nor paradise. He is the first, the last, the interior,
the exterior; I know but him, Yahu! Yahu! Menhu! I
looked up, and saw both worlds to be one; I see but one&mdash;I
seek but one&mdash;I know but one. My station is without
space, my mark without impression; it is not soul nor
body; I am the soul of souls. If I had passed one single
day without thee, I would repent to have lived one single
hour. When one day the friend stretches out his hand
<a name="Page_clxvi" id="Page_clxvi"></a><span class="pageno">clxvi</span>
to me in solitude, I tread the worlds under my feet, and
open my hands. O Shams Tabrizi,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_191" id="fnanchor_191"></a><a href="#footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></span>
I am so intoxicated
here that, except intoxication, no other remedy remains
to me.”</p>

<p>We know, by the preceding, what the Súfi is not;
we shall now learn what he is.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“O Moslims! I am intoxicated by love in the world. I
am a believer&mdash;an unbeliever&mdash;a drunken monk; I am the
Shaikhs Bayazid, Shubli, Juneid, Abu Hanifa, Shafei,
Hanbeli; I the throne and tent of heaven, from the dust
up to the Pleyads; I am whatever thou seest in separation
and enjoyment; I am the distance of two
bows-length<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_193" id="fnanchor_193"></a><a href="#footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></span>
around the throne; I am the Gospel, the Psalter, the
Koran; I am <span class="title">Usa</span> and
<span class="title">Lat</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_194" id="fnanchor_194"></a><a href="#footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></span>
the cross, the <span class="title">Bál</span> and
<span class="title">Dagon</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_195" id="fnanchor_195"></a><a href="#footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></span>
the Kâbah, and the place of sacrifice. The world is divided
into seventy-and-two sects, but there is but one God; the
believer in him am I; I am the lie, the truth, the good, the
evil, the hard and the soft, science, solitude, virtue, faith,
the deepest pit of hell, the greatest torment of flames, the
highest paradise, Huri, Risvan,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_196" id="fnanchor_196"></a><a href="#footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></span>
am I. What is the intent
<a name="Page_clxvii" id="Page_clxvii"></a><span class="pageno">clxvii</span>
of this speech? Say it, O Shams Tabrizi! The intended
meaning is: I am the soul of the world.”</p>

<p>After having sounded human nature in its depth,
and viewed it in its various forms, the Muhammedan
philosophers conceived a high idea of man in
general, and call him <dfn>insan kamil</dfn>, “the perfect man.”
He is the reunion of all the worlds, divine and naturaf,
universal and partial; he the book, the pure,
sublime, and venerable pages of which are not to be
touched, nor can be comprehended, but by those
who have thrown off the dark veils of ignorance.
His soul is to his body what the universal soul is to
the great world, which bears the name of “the
great man.”</p>

<p>Sir William Jones refers,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_197" id="fnanchor_197"></a><a href="#footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></span>
for a particular detail
of Súfi metaphysics and theology, to the Dabistán.
These are given with a particular phraseology, for
which it is not easy to find corresponding expressions
in any European language; and which I have
endeavored, to the best of my power, to explain in
my notes. A particular signification is attached
even to the most common terms, such as state,
station, time, duration, existence, non-existence,
possibility, presence, absence, testimony, sanctity,
annihilation, etc., etc. Besides, we find particular
divisions and classifications: different attributions
<a name="Page_clxviii" id="Page_clxviii"></a><span class="pageno">clxviii</span>
and names of the Deity, the unity of which is to be
preserved in all; the division of spirits, prophetism,
true and false miracles, revelation, inspiration; four
sorts of mankind, as many of life and death; seven
degrees of contemplative life, in each of which degrees
the Súfi sees a different color; four lights of
God; four sorts of manifestations, the sign of which
is annihilation, called “the science,” or “positive
knowledge.” Further we meet with a metempsychosis
for the imperfect soul, and an <em>appearance</em>
for the perfect; even with a geography of the invisible,
the land of shades in the towns of <span class="place">Jabilkha</span>,
<span class="place">Jabilsa</span>, and <span class="place">Barzah</span>, etc., etc.; and, in addition,
manifo I pinions of Asiatic philosophy.</p>

<p>Here should be pointed out how Muhammedan or
other Súfis may be confounded with the Hindu Yogis
or Sanyásis, although in reality distinguishable from
each other. The Yajur veda, and other sacred books
of the latter inculcate the precept that a man ought
to acquire perfect indifference concerning the whole
exterior world, and in all places to lay aside the
notion of diversity. This is what a Yogi or Sanyasi
endeavors to attain: he quits every thing, house,
wife, children, even his <em>caste</em>; the world has no
more right upon him than he upon the world. In
this he agrees with the Súfi; but the latter generally
aspires to the divine gift of inspiration, prophetism,
mystical enthusiasm, whilst the common
<a name="Page_clxix" id="Page_clxix"></a><span class="pageno">clxix</span>
state of a Yogi is that of complete impassiveness or
torpor.</p>

<p>It is only towards the end of the Dabistán that
Mohsan Fani mentions particularly the <span class="title">Sabeans</span>,
whose religion was, from the very beginning of the
work, treated of under different names of the ancient
Persian religions, such as <span class="title">Yezdanians</span>, Jamsaspians,
etc., etc.</p>

 Shams-eddin Tabrisi, whom Jelal-eddin names at the end of nearly
all his lyric poems, is said to have been the son of Khuand Ala-eddin,
chief of the Assassins (Ismâilahs). He gained a great celebrity as a Súfi
and a saint. From Tabriz, from which town he took his surname, he came
to Konia; there Jelal-eddin chose him for his spiritual guide, and remained
attached to him all his life, which terminated A. D. 1262. Shams-eddin
survived him. The tombs of the master and disciple, near each other in
Konia, are even in our days objects of veneration to pious Muselmans.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p class="p2 center"><abbr title="Section Fifteen">§ XV.</abbr>&mdash;<span class="sc">Recapitulation of the contents of the
Dabistan.</span></p>

<p>Thus I have indicated the principal contents of the
Dabistán. Considering the philosophic opinions
touched upon, we may remark that truth, although
in different times and places variously colored, veiled,
sometimes mutilated, often running into falsehood,
is nevertheless widely diffused, inasmuch as it reappears
in the concurring declarations of the greatest
thinkers of all times. Thus, among the notions
of the Asiatics, we find implied the sense of the
<span lang="el" xml:lang="el">ἐντελέχεια</span> (<dfn>entelechia</dfn>) of Aristotle, this untranslatable
word,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_198" id="fnanchor_198"></a><a href="#footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></span>
which however can but signify “some continued
<a name="Page_clxx" id="Page_clxx"></a><span class="pageno">clxx</span>
and perennial motion,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_199" id="fnanchor_199"></a><a href="#footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></span>
activity, moving
force, perfection, principle of things”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_200" id="fnanchor_200"></a><a href="#footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></span>&mdash;we
find
<em>time</em> and <em>space</em>, the necessary substrata of all our
notions, as taught by the Kantians&mdash;the want of
substantial reality in the objects of senses, maintained
by the sceptics in general&mdash;the prototypes
and ideas of the Pythagoreans and Platonists&mdash;the
necessary connections of all things of the Stoics&mdash;the
atomic doctrine of Moschus, Leucippus, Democritus,
Empedocles, etc.&mdash;the universality of sensation
and life of the Hermetites&mdash;the preformation
and pre-existence of the soul, alleged by Synesius,
Leibnitz, and others&mdash;the successive transformation,
transmigration, gradual perfection of beings; the periodical
renovation of the world professed by many
Greek schools&mdash;the palingenesis of Bonnet&mdash;the <em>one</em>
and the <em>all</em> of Parmenides, Plotinus, Synesius, Spinoza,
not to omit the refined Egoismus of Fichte,
etc., etc. I shall not proceed further in the enumeration
of opinions ascribed in the Dabistán to
different sects, and reproduced in the doctrine of
<a name="Page_clxxi" id="Page_clxxi"></a><span class="pageno">clxxi</span>
celebrated ancient and modern philosophers of Europe.
Who will realize that criterion of true philosophy
indicated by the great Leibnitz, namely,
that which would at once collect and explain the
fragments of truth scattered through all, and apparently
the most incongruous, systems?</p>

<p>This is perhaps the prize to be gained, not by one
mortal, but by a series of generations, in a laborious
task, so often interrupted and recommenced, but
never abandoned. The struggle of the human mind
is without term, but not without aim. We see
two principal movers of human intellect&mdash;<span class="muchsmaller">PHILOSOPHY</span>
and <span class="muchsmaller">RELIGION</span>. The one employs reason as a
sufficient power for the solution of a solvable problem,
which comprehends knowledge, morality,
and civilisation. The other distrusts reason, and
relies upon a supernatural power for the revelation
of a secret, or for the word of an enigma, which
relates to a destination beyond the bounds of this
world. The philosopher, self-confident, is liable
to error for various reasons; but always capable of
correction and improvement, in the only possible
way, that of self-activity, the virtuous exertions of
his faculties towards attainable perfection in his
whole condition. The religionist is exposed to
deception by his gratuitous faith in superhuman
guidance, and, if mistaken, is precluded from regress
and improvement by his essential virtue, fidelity;
<a name="Page_clxxii" id="Page_clxxii"></a><span class="pageno">clxxii</span>
that is, the pious surrender of his soul to a
spiritual and mystical sovereignty. The Dabistán
shows us more religionists than philosophers; it is
the school of sects, or rather that of inveterate
superstition, with which, in spite of the correctives
which human nature affords to its errors, the general
character of the Asiatics remains stamped, from
time immemorial to the present day.</p>

<p>Although the twelve chapters of the Dabistán
bear the titles of as many religions, the author says
himself, at the end of his work, that there are only
<em>five</em> great religions&mdash;those of the Hindus, Persians,
Jews, Nazareans, and Muselmans. He no where
mentions the Egyptians nor the Chinese, apparently
because, in his times and long before, no trace of the
Egyptian religion existed, although it certainly had
once occupied a great circle of influence, and because
the Chinese creed was known to be Buddhism.</p>

<p>The five religions mentioned constitute indeed so
many bases, upon which the whole creed of mankind
has been, and remains founded. They comprise, in
general, <dfn>polytheism</dfn> and <dfn>monotheism</dfn>. In all times and
places, the religion of the “Enlightened” was distinguished
from that of the “Vulgar;” the first as
interior, being the product of universal reason, was
every where nearly uniform; the second, as exterior,
being composed of particular and arbitrary
<a name="Page_clxxiii" id="Page_clxxiii"></a><span class="pageno">clxxiii</span>
rites and ceremonies, varied according to the influence
of the climate, and the character, history, and
civilisation of a people. But, in the course of time,
no religion remained entirely the same, either in
principle or form. Polytheism, by mere simplification,
tended to monotheism; this itself, in its
awful incomprehensibility, was modified according
as it originated, or assumed its notions, from anthropomorphism,
hylozoism, spiritualism, or pantheism.
Nor did any religion remain simple and pure, as
proceeding from only one principle; all religious
ideas, elemental, sidereal, allegorical, symbolical,
mystical, philosophical, and others were mixed, as
well as all sorts of worship interwoven. It is now
impossible to range in chronological order their rise
and transition into different forms. Still the one
or the other of these kinds predominated: thus
<dfn>physiolatry</dfn>, or “the adoration of personified nature,”
in India; <dfn>astrolatry</dfn>, or “the worship of stars,” in
Arabia and Iran; none of the religions entirely disclaimed
<dfn>monotheism</dfn>, which was positively and exclusively
professed in Judaism, Christianity, and
Muhammedanism.</p>

<p>Magism and the three last-named religions were
founded or modified by holy personages, or prophets,
that is, by individuals whose historical existence
in more or less remote times is positively
fixed; Hinduism alone acknowledges <span class="title">Manu</span> as an ideal
<a name="Page_clxxiv" id="Page_clxxiv"></a><span class="pageno">clxxiv</span>
or mythological person, whose laws are however
derived from Brahma himself. This may perhaps
be assumed as a proof of its remotest antiquity; and
India, having been less disturbed by invasions, and
conquered in much later times by foreign nations,
preserved its institutes complete in their originality.
There is scarcely a tenet to be found in any other
creed which does not, at least in its germ, exist in
the Hindu religion.</p>

<p>It is most remarkable that, although men revered
as divine messengers of religion have existed, still
the works containing the heaven-sent doctrine are,
either not at all or not incontestably, ascribed to
them; and in any case devolved upon posterity in a
more or less corrupted and mutilated state; so as to
entail for ever an inexhaustible subject of dispute, a
heavy task for belief, and severe trial of faith. If
the Vedas are the best preserved, it is to no general
purpose, inasmuch as they are the least
known and most obscure. These facts the author
of the Dabistán has set in full light, and
says,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_201" id="fnanchor_201"></a><a href="#footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></span> as
it were to tranquillise mankind with regard to the
multifarious inheritance of their prophets: “The
varieties and multitudes of the rules of prophets
proceed only from the plurality of names; and as
in names there is no mutual opposition or contradiction,
the superiority in rank among them is
<a name="Page_clxxv" id="Page_clxxv"></a><span class="pageno">clxxv</span>
only the predominance of a name. To this I subjoin
another passage, although it occurs in connection
with another subject:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_202" id="fnanchor_202"></a><a href="#footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></span>
“The time of a prophet
is a universal one, having neither priority nor
posteriority&mdash;neither morning nor evening:”
that is, if I understand these words: As the same
sun ever shines upon us, so shines the same wisdom
of all times, incorruptible in its divine source.</p>

<p>If we take a rapid comparative view of the principal
features of the five religions mentioned, we find
<em>emanation of all beings, intellectual and material, from
one great source</em>, to be the fundamental and characteristic
dogma of Hinduism, established and developed
in the most explicit and positive manner.
<em>The division of supernatural beings in good and bad</em> is
adopted in the five religions, but in Magism it is of
a somewhat different origin: for Ahriman and his
host are not rebellious or fallen good genii; they
are an original creation. <em>A primitive innocence and
posterior corruption</em> is generally believed; but by the
Hindus as coming from riches and abundance, by
the other nations as caused by seduction of the bad
spirits. <em>The destruction of mankind by a deluge</em> is no
part of the Persian creed; it occurs in the Indian
as one of the past periodical renovations of the
world, which are to be followed by others, and is
also admitted by the Persians, whilst the Jews,
<a name="Page_clxxvi" id="Page_clxxvi"></a><span class="pageno">clxxvi</span>
Christians, and Muhammedans believe a deluge not
very ancient, as a punishment of human depravity.
<em>Incarnations of the Deity for the benefit of mankind</em>, are
believed only by Hindus and Christians; to the
latter belongs exclusively the dogma of <em>a propitiatory
sacrifice. Human souls, immaterial</em>, have pre-existence
according to the Vedas and the Zand-Avesta; in the
first, as parts of the Divinity; in the latter, as created
in their <dfn>fervers</dfn>, or “pre-established ideals” at the
beginning of the world. <dfn>Transmigration</dfn> is taught
in the sacred books of the Hindus and Persians.
<em>The immortality of the soul, reserved to future beatitude
or damnation</em>, is maintained generally, less positively,
by the ancient Jews; the righteous are cheered by
the prospect of the same heaven, the wicked threatened
by the same punishments, which are held to
be eternal by Christians and Muhammedans; the
Hindus and Persians place the future life in a long
series of purifications or <dfn>purgatories</dfn>, leading, howsoever
late, finally to heaven, to which, according
to the first, the most perfect only are admitted immediately
after their terrestrial life, and are not to
be born again, except by their own choice. <em>The
resurrection with the same body, and the last judgment</em>,
are among the most essential tenets of the Magi,
Christians, and Muhammedans; the other world is
vaguely represented among the ancient Hebrews.
It is just to attribute to the Persians exclusively one
<a name="Page_clxxvii" id="Page_clxxvii"></a><span class="pageno">clxxvii</span>
of the most beautiful personifications that was ever
imagined:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_203" id="fnanchor_203"></a><a href="#footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></span>
the soul of the deceased meets at the
bridge of eternity an apparition either of an attractive
or repulsive form; “Who art thou?” asks the
uncertain spirit, and hears the answer: “I am thy
life.”</p>

<p>Although the variety and multitude of human
conceptions may appear boundless, yet they may
perhaps be reduced to a few fundamental principles.
In general, there is one object common to all sorts
of religion: this is to detach man from gross sensual
matters, and to accustom him to hold converse
with holy supernatural beings, guides to salvation,
<em>omnipresent</em> witnesses of all his actions, remunerators
of good, punishers of bad deeds; the belief in
such beings, one or more, is in fact the most
essential support of morality, which, being fixed in
each individual, insures the peace and happiness of
all. In short, the most important object of all
religion is to ennoble, refine, and sanctify man’s
inmost thoughts and feelings, as well as his exterior
actions. No wonder, that the same virtues are
recommended by all religions.</p>

<p>But, if these virtues be the same as to names,
there is a great difference as to their practical application.
Thus, the Hindus, tending excessively to
the extinction of sensual propensities, and a contemplative
<a name="Page_clxxviii" id="Page_clxxviii"></a><span class="pageno">clxxviii</span>
life, destroy spontaneity, and produce
apathy. The Persians recommend more practical
virtues. Both nations, however, as well as the
Jews and Muhammedans, are subject to a great
number of dietetical and ritual observances, which
divert them from useful activity, confine their practical
sense, and render inert the innate perfectibility,
the most precious prerogative of mankind. Among
all the Asiatic nations, considered in this work,
theocracy, that is, the junction of the religious and
civil laws, doubles the power of despotism, and
commands equally the spiritual and material, the
present and the future world. The Western Christians
were in the course of time fortunate enough
to modify the <em>Asiatic</em> morals, to enlarge the circle of
civilization, and to open to themselves a boundless
prospect of progressive knowledge, morality, and
happiness.</p>

<p>Finally, there is one idea common as an adjunct to
the five religions of mankind. Common are their
failings, common their sufferings, common is also
their consolation&mdash;hope. Always regretting a purity,
simplicity, and independence, supposed to have been
lost in the past, because not to be found any where
in the present, and never exempt from oppression,
men look to the future, and listen gladly to the
promise of universal reform and restoration to one
rule, which each religionist says, will be his own,
<a name="Page_clxxix" id="Page_clxxix"></a><span class="pageno">clxxix</span>
to be effected among the Hindus by <span class="title">Kalki</span>, an incarnation
of Brahma<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_204" id="fnanchor_204"></a><a href="#footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></span>,

<h4 class="h4head">CONCLUSION.</h4>

<p class="p2 center"><abbr title="section">§</abbr> <span class="sc">General
appreciation of the Dabistan and its
Author.</span></p>

<p class="p2">Mohsan Fáni collected in the Dabistán, as I hope
to have shown by a rapid review of its principal contents,
various important information concerning
religions of different times and countries. His
accounts are generally clear, explicit, and deserving
<a name="Page_clxxx" id="Page_clxxx"></a><span class="pageno">clxxx</span>
confidence; they agree in the most material points
with those of other accredited authors. Thus, to
quote one more instance, the accuracy of his topographic
information relative to the marvellous fountain
in Kachmir is in the main confirmed by that
published by Bernier who had visited the country.
Our author enlivens his text by interesting quotations
from the works of famous poets and philosophers,
and by frequent references to books which
deserve to be known. I beg to mention the <dfn>Tabsaret
al âvam</dfn>, “Rendering quick-sighted the Vulgar,”
which he regrets not to have before his eyes. His
whole work is interspersed with anecdotes and
sayings, characteristic of individuals and sects
which existed in his times. To what he relates from
personal observation or other sources, he frequently
adds reflections of his own, which evince a sagacious
and enlightened mind. Thus, he exhibits in
himself an interesting example of Asiatic erudition
and philosophy.</p>

<p>The Dabistán adds, if I am not mistaken, not
only a few ideas to our historical knowledge, but
also some features to the picture which we hitherto
possessed of the Asiatics. May I be permitted to
quote a remarkable instance relative to the latter?
We are wont to speak of the inherent apathy and
stationary condition of the Muhammedans, as an
effect of their legislation. Although this general idea
<a name="Page_clxxxi" id="Page_clxxxi"></a><span class="pageno">clxxxi</span>
of their character and state be not unfounded, yet it
is carried to such an exaggerated degree, that we
think them incapable of progress. We may therefore
be astonished to find in the work before
us<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_206" id="fnanchor_206"></a><a href="#footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></span> a
maxim such as this: “He who does not proceed,
retrogrades,” and beside a declaration attributed to
Muhammed himself: “He whose days are alike is
deceived.” Our author, it is true, interprets it in
the particular point of view of an orthodox Súfi,
who thinks that there is a degree of mental perfection,
beyond which it is impossible to rise: this
was, he says, the state of Muhammed, the prophet,
always the same, from which no ascent nor descent
was possible, the perfection of unity with God,
higher than whom nothing can be: <em>the blackness beyond
which no color can go</em>. With the exception of these
fits of mysticism, now and then occurring, it is just
to say that Mohsan Fani most commonly leans to
the side of progressive reform.</p>

<p>For the just appreciation of his work, I think it
necessary to point out another opinion, which, very
generally entertained, requires to be considerably
modified: I mean that which attributes to the Muhammedans
an unrestrained intolerance in religious
matters. On that account, I beg to refer directly
to the book, which to them always was the sacred
source of all rules and precepts of conduct&mdash;the
<a name="Page_clxxxii" id="Page_clxxxii"></a><span class="pageno">clxxxii</span>
Koran. In this astonishing farrago of truth and
falsehood, we find here and there a great extent of
toleration. In fact, Muhammedism was eclectic in
all the religious ideas of its time, Magian, Jewish, and
Christian. Muhammed avowed himself to be “a
man like every body;”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_207" id="fnanchor_207"></a><a href="#footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></span>
he did not pretend, that
“the treasures of God were in his power,” nor did
he say “that he knew the secrets of God, neither
that he was an angel; no; he thought only to
follow what was revealed to
him,”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_208" id="fnanchor_208"></a><a href="#footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></span> so much
every body else may say and think, He professed
his good-will to Christians, “as inclinable
to entertain friendship for the true believers;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_209" id="fnanchor_209"></a><a href="#footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></span> he
exhorted his followers not to dispute, but in the
mildest manner,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_210" id="fnanchor_210"></a><a href="#footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></span>
against those who have received
the Scripture, and wished to come to a just determination
between both parties, that they all
worshipped not any but God.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_211" id="fnanchor_211"></a><a href="#footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></span>&mdash;“Abraham,”
said he, “was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but
one resigned unto God (Moslim); excellence is in
the hand of God; he gives it unto whom he
pleaseth.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_212" id="fnanchor_212"></a><a href="#footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></span>&mdash;Still
more; the prophet seems to
give a general license to the professors of every
<a name="Page_clxxxiii" id="Page_clxxxiii"></a><span class="pageno">clxxxiii</span>
religion to observe certain rites about which he
prohibits all disputes;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_213" id="fnanchor_213"></a><a href="#footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></span>
nay, he declares: “If the
Lord had pleased, verily, all who are in the earth
would have believed in general. Wilt thou therefore
forcibly compel men to be true believers? No
soul can believe but by the permission of God.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_214" id="fnanchor_214"></a><a href="#footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>Although the Arabian prophet and his followers
too often gave by their conduct a strong denial to
these principles, still the existence of them in the
Koran was a sanction to all those who were disposed
to profess them in words and actions. Such sentiments
of religious toleration are in accordance with
similar ones expressed in many Christian moral
treatises, but in none of the latter do I remember
to have read: “that the diversities of religions distributed
among nations, according to the exigency
of each, are manifestations of the divine light
and power, and that these various forms, by which
God’s inscrutable essence may be viewed by
glimpses, are means of possessing eternal beatitude,
whilst here below the acquisition of knowledge
is sufficient to insure to mankind the
enjoyment of concord, friendship, and agreeable
intercourse.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_215" id="fnanchor_215"></a><a href="#footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>These appear to be the maxims adopted by the
<a name="Page_clxxxiv" id="Page_clxxxiv"></a><span class="pageno">clxxxiv</span>
Súfis, and particularly by those among them who,
under Akbar, professed to be <span class="title">Ilahians</span>. The creed
of this class exists in our days, although the name
has not survived. To these we may suppose, if to
any, Mohsan Fáni belonged. If we could agree
with Erskine that “he was in strict intimacy with
the sect of enthusiasts by whom the Desátir was
venerated,” we should still be obliged to avow,
that his enthusiasm had not in the least influenced
his free judgment upon religious matters. His imagination
although justly exalted by sublime notions
of the Divinity, certainly appears now and then bewildered
by the mysterious action of unknown causes;
but on other occasions pointing out, in a satirical
vein, so many follies, absurdities, and extravagances
prevailing among mankind, he seems to laugh at all
enthusiasm whatsoever, his own not excepted. In
general, there breathes in his words a spirit of independence,
which would command attention even
among us in the accustomed circle of long-established
liberty. His boldness in religious controversy startled
even sir W. Jones so much that, in characterising
it by the harsh term of <em>blasphemy</em>, the English
judge appears for a moment ready to plead for the
abettors of popular superstition, who stood confounded
before the tribunal of the philosophic
Akbar.</p>

<p>I shall however not conceal, that Mohsan Fani
<a name="Page_clxxxv" id="Page_clxxxv"></a><span class="pageno">clxxxv</span>
sometimes paid tribute to the prevailing ignorance
and inveterate prejudices of his time, and above all,
to the sovereign power of early impressions; nor
that, although in many respects he offers in himself
an honorable exception to the general character of
his countrymen, he now and then confounds himself
with them. Thus, he was far from being above
all popular superstition. The Asiatic, from the
dawn of his reason, is nourished with the marvellous,
trained to credulity, and prepared for mysticism,
the bane of practical life; in short, he imbibes
from his infancy a superstition from which he never
frees himself, always prone to interpret every unusual
phenomenon as a miracle. No sort of study
enables him to correct his first impressions, or to
enlighten his ignorance; natural history and experimental
philosophy are not cultivated in Asia. If
not an agriculturist, mechanic, tradesman, or soldier,
he devotes himself to the intricacies of metaphysics,
and very commonly to a contemplative life;
he becomes an ascetic. Thus he knows no social life
embellished by the refinement of mutual sympathy,
nor the noble vocations of a citizen who lives&mdash;with
more than one life in himself, in others, and in the
whole community. Such being the general state of
Asia, let us not wonder that Mohsan Fani believed
some strange stories of miracles, and viewed with
astonishment tricks of jugglers, which he relates
<a name="Page_clxxxvi" id="Page_clxxxvi"></a><span class="pageno">clxxxvi</span>
with serious credulity, strangely contrasting with
his usual good sense, sagacity, and judgment. Thus,
he presents to us a man standing on his head with
his heels in the air during a whole night; others
restraining their breath many hours, and remaining
immoveable during two or three days; he speaks of
the miraculous effects of austerity, such as being in
different places at the same time; resuscitating the
dead; understanding the language of animals, vegetables,
and minerals; walking on the surface of
water, and through fire and air; commanding the
elements; leaving and reassuming the body; and
the like. But let us not forget that such stories were
told elsewhere, and in Europe, even so late as the
time in which the Dabistán was written.</p>

<p>Further, although generally moral and judicious
in his sentences, grave and austere in his views, fervent
and exalted in devout contemplation, our author
now and then happens to use the language of ribaldry
and indecency, which deserves serious reprobation.
We shall however remark that taste, or
the sense of propriety in words and expressions
among Asiatics differs, as much as their general
civilisation, from ours. From religious austerity
they banished the elegant arts, as objects of sensuality;
but, as they could not stifle this essential part
of human nature, they only prevented its useful
refinement; they clipt the delicate flower, but left
<a name="Page_clxxxvii" id="Page_clxxxvii"></a><span class="pageno">clxxxvii</span>
the brute part of it: hence the grossness of their
jokes, expressions, and images. “To sacrifice to
the graces” is, among them, not understood at
all, or thought an abomination. But they cannot
be said to <em>violate</em> laws which they do not know; the
offence which they give from want of taste and decency,
is purely unintentional, and cannot with them
have that evil effect which, among us, it would be
likely to produce.</p>

<p>As to the general style of the Dabistán&mdash;it is only
in the original text itself, that it can be justly appreciated.
It will perhaps sufficiently appear from
our translation that it distinguishes itself favorably
among other Oriental works with which it may be
compared. The diction is generally free from their
usual bombast; it is commonly clear, and when
obscure to an European reader, it is so on account
of the strangeness and abstruseness of the matter
treated. As to form&mdash;if judged according to the
rules of Western criticism, the work of Mohsan Fani
may be found deficient in the distribution and
arrangement of matter; there are useless repetitions,
incoherences, disorder, abrupt digressions, and excess,
sonetimes of prolixity, at others of concision.
Although we have reason to praise him for generally
naming the source from which he drew his information,
still we can but regret, now and then, his
not sufficiently authenticating nor explaining the
<a name="Page_clxxxviii" id="Page_clxxxviii"></a><span class="pageno">clxxxviii</span>
particulars which he relates. Thus we could
wish him to have been more explicit concerning
the Desátir. Upon the whole, we cannot accuse
him of not having performed what, in his time and
circumstances, was hardly possible, and what hitherto
no Asiatic author has achieved. We ought to
keep in mind how much, with respect to the perfection
of literary publications, we owe solely to the
art of printing, the practice of which, by its own
nature, necessitates and facilitates a manifold revision
and correction of the text, which otherwise could
hardly take place. This alone sufficiently accounts
for the frequent defects even of the best manuscript
works.</p>

<p>Striking an equitable balance between faults and
excellencies, and with particular regard to the
abundance of curious, useful, and important information,
I shall not hesitate to express my sincere
persuasion, that the Dabistán was worthy of the
eulogy bestowed by the great Orientalist who first
brought it into public notice.</p>

concerning the printed edition, some
manuscripts, and the translations of the Dabistan</span>.</p>

<p>It is well known, that the only printed edition of the
<a name="Page_clxxxix" id="Page_clxxxix"></a><span class="pageno">clxxxix</span>
Dabistán which exists is due to the press of Calcutta.
At the end of the work will be found the Epilogue of
the editor, <span class="person">Moulavi Nazer Ushruf</span>, a learned Muhammedan
gentleman of the district of Juanpur,
who was for many years employed in judicial offices
in the district of Burdwan, and in the court of
Sudder Diwani Adawlet, in Calcutta. These particulars
were communicated to me by the favor of the
honorable gentleman whose name the said editor
mentions in his Epilogue with encomium, the sincerity
of which can certainly not be questioned: it was
William Butterworth Bayley, at present director
and chairman of the Honorable East India Company.
It was he, a distinguished Persian scholar, who directed
and superintended the edition of the Dabistán.
Upon the strength of his authority I am enabled to
add, that the printed copy was the result of a careful
collation of several manuscript copies of this work.
One was obtained from Delhi (as mentioned in the
epilogue), and another from Bombay; two or three
were in the possession of natives in Calcutta.
Although these, as it is more or less the case with
all manuscripts, procurable in India, were defective,
yet we may believe the assurance given by the
editor, that “the doubts and faults have been as
much as possible discarded, and the edition
carried to a manifest accuracy.” This is confirmed
by the fact, that only a few discrepancies
<a name="Page_cxc" id="Page_cxc"></a><span class="pageno">cxc</span>
from the printed edition were found in two other
manuscripts, which were in England at the disposition
of the late David Shea for the translation of the
first part of the Dabistán. Nor did I find frequent
deviations from the printed text in the copy which
was transcribed for me in Calcutta from a manuscript,
procured from the library of the king of
Oude. Mutilated in many places, and imperfect as
is this latter, it afforded me nevertheless a few acceptable
readings. I was obliged to content myself
with the assistance of this only manuscript for the
translation, as several circumstances, among which
was the lamented death of the earl of Munster, prevented
me from obtaining the use of other manuscript
copies. All circumtances considered, I do not
hesitate to say, that the printed edition of the Dabistán
is more correct than any of the manuscript copies
which can be found; we have only to regret that
its typography, owing to the then imperfect state
of the Oriental press in Calcutta, is so irregular,
as to be scarce entitled to any preference over the
common sort of Persian manuscripts.</p>

<p>The English translation of the Dabistán was begun
some time before the year 1835, by David Shea, one
of the professors of Oriental languages at Hayleybury.
He was in his early years distinguished in
the university of Dublin for his classical attainments,
and remained devoted to literature in all the various
<a name="Page_cxci" id="Page_cxci"></a><span class="pageno">cxci</span>
circumstances of his life. It was not for, nor in,
India&mdash;the great object and school of English students&mdash;but
in Malta, from peculiar inducement,
that, by uncommon application, he acquired the
Arabic and Persian languages. After his return to
England, having been attached to the Hayleybury
college&mdash;I should not fail to add to his eulogy by saying,
that he had before won the kind interest and
recommendation of sir Graves Haughton&mdash;and having
become a member of the committee of the Oriental
Translation Fund, he earned the applause of Orientalists
in England, and on the continent of Europe,
by his faithful and spirited translation of Mirkhond’s
history of the early kings of Persia. Undertaking
the translation of the Dabistán, he was undoubtedly
preparing to himself a new success, the full
realisation of which he was not permitted to enjoy;
the last date in his manuscript copy, in which he
was wont to mark the progress of his labor, was
April 22, 1835. From this day he appears to have
withdrawn his hand from the Dabistán, and too
soon after&mdash;I shall be permitted to use the very
words of the author whom he was
translating:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_216" id="fnanchor_216"></a><a href="#footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>It was in the beginning of the year 1837 that I
<a name="Page_cxcii" id="Page_cxcii"></a><span class="pageno">cxcii</span>
was honored by the earl of Munster, the vice president
of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain
and Ireland, with the proposal of completing and
editing the English Dabistán. Having already several
years before been occupied with the same work
whilst pursuing my Indian studies, I was so much the
more prompted to accept the proffered honor. Engaged
however as I then was in publishing my French
translation of the first six books of the <span class="title">Rajatarangini</span>
from the Sanscrit, I could not begin the new work
before 1841. This delay was the cause of my being
deprived of the desired honor and satisfaction of
presenting my translation to the earl of Munster, who
while in the full enjoyment of life, welcomed with
a benevolent interest every contribution, however
small, to the general diffusion of Oriental history and
literature; he had accepted in Paris my Dedication
a short time before his death; it remains to me to
consecrate, with a profound feeling of regret and
veneration for departed worth, the English Dabistán
to his memory.</p>

<p>I took charge of the manuscript copy of David
Shea’s version, which had been carried to page 201
of the printed Calcutta edition.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_217" id="fnanchor_217"></a><a href="#footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></span>
In this there were
only a few omissions to be supplied, and no other
rectifications to be made but those which a second
review would have suggested to my learned predecessor
<a name="Page_cxciii" id="Page_cxciii"></a><span class="pageno">cxciii</span>
himself; his notes, and those which I
thought necessary to add, are marked each with
the initials of our respective names.</p>

<p>If I found little to change, I had much to imitate
in David Shea’s translation&mdash;his faithfulness and
clearness. By faithfulness I understand not only
expressing truly the sense, but also keeping unaltered
the words, figures, images, and phrases of the
original, as it is in them that the author’s national
and individual peculiarity is manifested. This sort
of faithfulness may roughen or hamper the phrase,
destroy the elegance of style, and even offend good
taste, but by it alone we shall not only know, as
I have just observed, the genius of the foreign
writer, but also satisfy the exigencies of philology,
which is one of the main purposes of translations
not undertaken as mere exercises of improvable
eloquence.</p>

<p>An author will not employ more or other words
than those he thinks necessary for being understood
by readers of his own nation, religion, school; he
writes, for instance, as a Muhammedan for Muhammedans,
a Súfi for Súfis. But a translator must
do his best for uniting faithfulness with clearness,
the indispensable condition of any speech or writing;
he must add what is required for illustrating the
original text, and thus submit to a charge, now and
then heavier than he can bear.</p>

<p><a name="Page_cxciv" id="Page_cxciv"></a><span class="pageno">cxciv</span>
Under the necessity of expounding the translation
by notes, I was not actuated by the ambition of being
new, but only by that of being as useful as my
means permitted, that is, by endeavoring to spare
the reader time and trouble to look for dates and biographical
notices of the persons, the situation of the
places, and the explanation of the technical terms
which occur in the text. Orientalists know the
difficulty of rendering in a European language the
phraseology of the Asiatic theology and philosophy.
The Dabistán presents, besides the Sanscrit, a confusion
of Arabic and Persian technical expressions;
some of them have a very comprehensive signification,
and for the sake of clearness must be rendered
by different terms in different places; other expressions
have at times a particular sense, and are at
other times to be taken in the common acceptation;
the same terms must be translated by different
words, and different terms by the same; finally, the
matter treated of is frequently so abstruse in its
nature that professed philosophers have not yet been
able to agree upon some of the most important
questions. I can therefore but apprehend that I may
not have thoroughly understood, and must confess
that I have not translated, to my own satisfaction,
more than one passage relative to Indian doctrines,
and to the Muhammedan scholastic philosophy.</p>

<p>The Sanscrit names and terms of Indian mythology,
<a name="Page_cxcv" id="Page_cxcv"></a><span class="pageno">cxcv</span>
theology, and philosophy are much corrupted
by the Persian spelling; I have endeavored to restore
them to their original forms. I thought it right to
adduce in most cases the Sanscrit, Arabic, or Persian
word at the same time in Roman as well as
Devanagari, or Arabic characters, with its interpretation.
I followed the rule proposed by sir William
Jones for writing oriental words in Roman characters,
as often as I took these words from a Sanscrit,
Persian, or Arabic text; but from works written in
a European language, I was generally obliged to copy
the spelling of Oriental names: on which account,
in my notes, a regretable inequality of orthography
could not be avoided.</p>

<p>The Dabistán not only touches upon most difficult
points of science and erudition, but also comprises
in its allusions and references nearly the
whole history of Asia. In observing this, I am necessarily
at the same time pointing to the many deficiencies
which will be found in my attempts to
comment and illustrate so comprehensive and diversified
a text. The best advantage which a man
obtains at the termination of an arduous work, is to
have enabled himself to make it better, if he could
begin again; but he can but humbly submit to the
decrees of an all-ruling power, which bestows
upon each mortal only a certain measure of faculties
and of time.</p>

<p><a name="Page_cxcvi" id="Page_cxcvi"></a><span class="pageno">cxcvi</span>
Desirous to fulfil my task to the best of my abilities,
I did not neglect to consult every translation
of any part of the Dabistán which had been
published. I have already mentioned, in this
preface,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_218" id="fnanchor_218"></a><a href="#footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></span>
that Gladwin edited the Persian text
of a part of the first chapter with an English
version which was worthy of his reputation as
an excellent Orientalist. Every thing that came
from the pen of the late doctor Leyden deserved
attention. I had before my eyes his translation of
chapter <abbr title="Nine">IX.</abbr>, on the religion of the Roshenian.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_219" id="fnanchor_219"></a><a href="#footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></span> I did
not neglect the abridged interpretation of the religious
controversies held before Akbar, given in form
of a dialogue by the learned and ingenious Vans
Kennedy.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_220" id="fnanchor_220"></a><a href="#footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></span>
I perused with due regard the explanations
which the illustrious Silvestre de Sacy furnished
of some passages of the Dabistán<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_221" id="fnanchor_221"></a><a href="#footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></span>
since this
work became known to him in 1821, as well as
the remarks cursorily made upon it by some
Orientalists.</p>

<p>I did not fail also to profit by the advantages
which my residence in Paris, and my connections
<a name="Page_cxcvii" id="Page_cxcvii"></a><span class="pageno">cxcvii</span>
with distinguished cultivators of Oriental literature,
could afford me on behalf of my translation. It is
my duty to acknowledge the services which I received
from the kindness of M. Garcin de Tassy, professor
of Hindostanee, whose intimate acquaintance
with Arabic and Persian literature in general, and
with Muhammedan theology in particular, is attested
by several esteemed works which he has published.
The many Arabic passages, disseminated in the
Dabistán, have mostly been revised, interpreted,
and referred to the Koran, by him. M. Eugène Burnouf,
professor of Sanscrit, is never in vain consulted
concerning that part of ancient philology in which
he has acquired a most particular and eminent
distinction. I also constantly experienced the
most friendly readiness to tender me information,
when required, in M. Julius Mohl and baron Mac
Guckin de Slane, as well as in M. Reinaud, professor
of Arabic, attached to the Royal Library, a
most distinguished conservator and most complaisant
communicator of the valuable manuscripts
under his special charge. I beg these honorable gentlemen
to receive my sincerest acknowledgments.</p>

<p><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_228" id="fnanchor_228"></a><a href="#footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></span>Here
commences the history of the tenets
and ceremonies observed by the <span class="title">Sipásíán</span> and
<span class="title">Pársíán</span>.</p>

<p>Among the <span class="title">Parsíán</span>, called also the <span class="title">Iraníán</span>, is a
<a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 6</span>
sect styled the <span class="title">Yazadíán</span> or <span class="title">Yazdáníán</span>,
<span class="title">Abádíán</span>, <span class="title">Sipásíán</span>,
<span class="title">Hushián</span>, <span class="title">Anushkán</span>, <span class="title">Azarhóshangíán</span>, and
<span class="title">Azaríán</span>. They believe it impossible for man, by
the force of intellect, or the energy of spirit, to comprehend
the exalted essence of the Almighty and
Holy Lord. Entity, unity, identity, or all his divine
attributes of knowledge and life, constitute the fountain
of his holy essence. He is, in the most comprehensive
sense, the paramount, omnipotent Lord
over all things, whether considered collectively, or
in the changes incident to their component parts.
All his works and operations are in conformity to
his exalted will: if he wills, he acts; if he wills not,
he acts not; but works worthy of adoration are as
inseparable from his honored essence, as his other
glorious attributes of perfection.&mdash;Urfí of Shíráz
thus expresses himself:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“Thy essence is able to call into being all that is impossible,</div>
  <div class="i0">Except to create one like thyself.”</div>
 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>The first creation of his existence-bestowing
bounty was the precious jewel of the intellectual
principle, called <dfn>Azad Bahman</dfn>; the solar ray which
constitutes the excellence of his august existence is
from the essence of the light of lights. From the
effulgence of <dfn>Bahman</dfn>, or the “First Intelligence,”
proceeded another, along with the spirit and body
of the Pure Ether or Crystalline Sphere. In like
<a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 7</span>
manner from this second
<dfn>Serúsh</dfn><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_229" id="fnanchor_229"></a><a href="#footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></span>
or “angel” there
emanated three similar rays; so that every star in
the universe, whether in motion or at rest, that
is, every planet and fixed star, and also every one
of the heavens, has its peculiar intellect and spirit.</p>

<p>They also believe that the heavens exceed the compass
of numbers, and that the spheres are as many
in number as the stars: also that every star has its
own firmament, but that the movements of their
spheres are in accordance with those of the zodiacal
firmament.</p>

<p>In like manner, each of the four elements has its
separate guardian, from the <dfn>Nuristan</dfn> (region of
light), or the world of Intellects: which angel is
styled <dfn>Parvardigar</dfn> or <dfn>Parvardigar-i-Gunah</dfn>; <dfn>Dara</dfn> or
<dfn>Dara-i-Gunah</dfn>; and in Arabic, “<dfn>Rab-un-naw”</dfn> or
“Lord of the species;” in the same manner, all
their relations, or every species, has its peculiar
regent from the <dfn>Nuristan</dfn> or ‘region of light.’&mdash;They
regard the subsisting spirit of man, or the
<a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 8</span>
reasonable human soul, as eternal and infinite. Sáid
says thus:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“No sign of man or world appeared on the tablet of existence</div>
  <div class="i0">When the soul breathed forth pursuant to thy will in the school of love.”</div>
 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>It is related in some of the esteemed records of this
sect, that by <dfn>eternal souls</dfn> are meant, the spirits of
the spheres: and that human souls are a creation,
but eternal: also, that some human temperaments
are so constituted, that souls from the upper world
are conferred on them: whilst others are adapted
for having attached to them souls abstracted from
matter; that such appropriation is regulated by
influence of the spheres, and is concealed from the
sight of the most profound thinkers. They also say,
when this immortal spirit attains to eminence in
praise-worthy knowledge and belief, that is, pure
faith and good works, that on leaving this lower
body, it succeeds in uniting itself to the sublime
uncompounded spirits: but should it not attain to
this high, emancipation-bestowing degree, it is united
to that sphere, in relation to which its acts were
upright. If the habitual language were praise-worthy
and the works performed meritorious, but it should
not have attained to the rank of union with a sphere,
it being then divested of corporeal elements, remains
in the lower world with the similitude of a bodily
form, and in consequence of its praise-worthy qualities,
it enjoys in appearance the view of the nymphs,
<a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 9</span>
palaces, and bright rose-bowers of paradise, and
becomes a <dfn>Zamíní-Serush</dfn>, or ‘Terrestrial Angel.’
But if its words have been
reprehensible,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_230" id="fnanchor_230"></a><a href="#footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></span> and also
accompanied with evil deeds, on deserting this material
body, it obtains not another similarly constituted
and is unable to reach the <dfn>Shídastan</dfn> or ‘the region
of Light.’ Being thus separated from the primitive
source, it remains in the abode of Elements, in the
Hell of concupiscence and passion and the flames of
remorse: ultimately it becomes the prey of malady,
but does not obtain a higher mansion: the soul of
such a description finally becomes an <dfn>Ahriman</dfn>, or
‘Evil Demon.’ If in a spirit destitute of praiseworthy
conversation, the good actions
preponderate,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_231" id="fnanchor_231"></a><a href="#footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></span>
but in consequence of the attachment of the
heart to matter, or through ignorance, such a spirit
attains not to the dignity of liberation, it removes
from one body to another, until by the efficacy of
good words and deeds, it is finally emancipated from
body and gains a high rank. Sarábí thus says:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“The truly free, as soon as possible, disengages himself from body:</div>
  <div class="i0">If he cannot extricate himself from skin, let him resign his doublet.”</div>
 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 10</span>
But if the spirit be prone to error, it descends
successively from the human frame to the animal
body: such are the doctrines of their distinguished
men. Some however of this sect, in whose language
all is metaphorical and figurative, assert, that sometimes
the spirit, through excessive wickedness, becomes
by insensible degrees connected with plants
and vegetables; and frequently, by progressive gradations,
becomes joined to mineral or metallic substances.
According to this class of believers, there
is an uncompounded soul in each of the three kingdoms
of nature: and they acknowledge that every
thing possesses a ray of existence emanating from
<dfn>Shíd Shídan</dfn>, or ‘Effulgence of Light.’ One of the
eminent men, agreeably to this view, has said:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“The soul is the marrow of certainty, the body its envelope:</div>
  <div class="i0">In the robes of spirit contemplate the form of a friend (the Creator).</div>
  <div class="i0">Whatever object bears the impress of existence,</div>
  <div class="i0">Regard it as the reflexion of light, or his very self.”</div>
 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>They also hold that the world bears the same
affinity to the Creator, as the solar light doth to the
body of the sun; that it has existed from all eternity
and will continue to all infinity. They maintain
that, whatever exists in this world, or that of formation
and evanescence, depends on the influence of
the stars; also that astronomers and astrologers
<a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 11</span>
have found out some few effects of the influence of
the seven planets, but are ignorant of the natures and
influences of the slow-moving or fixed stars. The
possessors of <dfn>Fardát</dfn> and <dfn>Fartáb</dfn>, or those who are
directed by inspiration and revelation, have laid
down that every star, whether fixed or planetary,
is regent during certain periods of several thousand
years: one thousand years being assigned to each
star, without the association of any other: on the
termination of which, in the subsequent millennia,
both the fixed and planetary stars are successively
associated with it&mdash;that is, in commencing the series
with a fixed star, we call the fixed star which is Lord
of the Cycle, the First King; on the termination of
the millennium appropriated to him, another fixed
star becomes partner with the First King, which
partner we style First Minister: but the supremacy
and dominion of the period belong exclusively to the
First King: on the termination of the second millennium,&mdash;the
period of office assigned to the First
Minister expires, and another star is associated with
the First King; and so on, until the fixed stars are
all gone through: on which Saturn becomes associated
with the First King, and continues so during
a thousand years, and so with the other planets,
until the period of association with the moon arrives:
then terminates the supremacy of the fixed star,
named the First King, and his authority expires.
<a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 12</span>
After the First King, the star associated with him
in the second millennium, and which was called the
First Minister, now attains the supremacy and becomes
Lord of the Cycle, during which cycle of
sovereignty we style him the Second King, with a
thousand years appropriated to his special rule as
before stated. In the following millennium another
fixed star becomes his associate, as above mentioned,
and goes through a similar course. When the period
of the moon’s association arrives, the moon remains
joined with the Second King during a millennium,
on the completion of which, that fixed star, the term
of whose sovereignty has passed away, and who
commenced the cycle, under the style of First King,
is associated with the Lord of the Cycle, styled the
Second King; after which, the empire of the Second
King’s star also terminates and becomes transferred
to another: thus all the fixed stars in succession
become kings, until they are all gone through, on
which the principality and supremacy come to <dfn>Shat
Kaivan</dfn>, or ‘the Lord Saturn,’ with whom in like
manner the fixed stars and planets are associated
for their respective millennia,&mdash;when the dominion
comes to the <dfn>Shat Máh</dfn>, or ‘Lunar Lord,’ his period
is ended as before stated, the cycle completed, and
one great circle or revolution has been described.&mdash;On
the expiration of this great period, the sovereignty
reverts to the First King; the state of the
<a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 13</span>
revolving world recommences; this world of formation
and evanescence is renovated; the human beings,
animals, vegetable and mineral productions
which existed during the first cycle, are restored to
their former language, acts, dispositions, species and
appearance, with the same designations and distinctions;
the successive regenerations continually
proceeding on in the same manner. The prince of
physicians, <span class="title">Abu Alí</span> (whose spirit may God sanctify!)
expresses himself to this purport:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i2b">“<em>Every</em> form and image, which seems at present effaced,</div>
  <div class="i2">Is securely stored up in the treasury of time&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i2">When the same position of the heavens again recurs,</div>
  <div class="i0">The Almighty reproduces each from behind the mysterious veil.”</div>
 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>It is here necessary to remark, that their meaning
is not, that the identical spirits of <span class="title">Abad</span>, <span class="title">Kaiomors</span>,
<span class="title">Siáymak</span> and <span class="title">Húshang</span> shall be imparted to the identical
material bodies long since abandoned, or that
the scattered members of the body shall be reassembled
and reunited: such sentiments, according to
them, are absurd and extravagant: their real belief
is this, that forms similar to those which have passed
away, and bodies resembling the primitive ones,
their counterpart in figure, property and shape, shall
appear, speaking and acting exactly in the same manner.
How could the exalted spirits of the perfect,
which are united with angels, return back? They
also maintain that men do not arise from their own
species, without father or mother: but they affirm
<a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 14</span>
that, as a man and woman were left at the commencement
of the past cycle, so there shall two
remain in the present cycle, for the continuance
of the human race. For although the heavens are
the sires of the three natural kingdoms or productive
principles, and the elements their mother,
yet this much only has been imparted to us, that
man is born of man, and is not produced after any
other fashion.</p>

<p>The followers of the ancient faith call one revolution
of the regent Saturn, a day; thirty such days,
one month; twelve such months, one year; a million
of such years, one <dfn>fard</dfn>;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_232" id="fnanchor_232"></a><a href="#footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></span>
a million <dfn>fard</dfn>, one
<dfn>vard</dfn>; a million <dfn>vard</dfn>, one <dfn>mard</dfn>; a million <dfn>mard</dfn>, one
<dfn>jád</dfn>; three thousand <dfn>jád</dfn>, one <dfn>vád</dfn>; and two thousand
<dfn>vád</dfn>, one <dfn>zád</dfn>.<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></span>&mdash;According
to this mode of computation,
the happiness and splendor of the Máhábádian
dynasty lasted one hundred zád of years. They
believe it impossible to ascertain the commencement
<a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 15</span>
of human existence; and that it is not to be comprehended
by human science: because there is no epoch
of identical persons, so that it is absolutely impossible
to form any definite ideas on the subject, which
resembles an arithmetical infinite series. Such a
belief also agrees with the philosophy and opinions
of the Grecian sages.</p>

<p>From the authority of esteemed works, they account
<span class="title">Máhábád</span> the first of the present cycle; as in
reality he and his wife were the survivors of the
great period, and the bounteous Lord had bestowed
on them so immense a progeny, that from their
numbers, the very clefts of the mountains were
filled. The author of the <span class="title">Amíghistan</span> relates, that
they were acquainted only to a trifling degree with
the viands, drinks and clothing which through the
bounty of God are now met with: besides, in that
cycle there existed no organization of cities, systems
of policy, conditions of supremacy, rules of authority
and power, principles of <dfn>Nushád</dfn> or law, nor instruction
in science and philosophy, until through the
aid of celestial grace, joined to the manifold favors
and bounties of God, the uncontrolled authority of
<span class="title">Máhábád</span> pervaded alike the cultivated region and
the wild waste; the wide expanse of land and sea.
Through divine illumination, in conjunction with
his spiritual nature, the assistance of his guiding
angel and the eyes of discernment; and also what
<a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 16</span>
he had seen and heard in the past cycle, he meditated
on the creation of the world: he then clearly
perceived that the nine superior divisions, and the
four lower elements, the subjects of existence, are
blended and associated with distinct essences and
accidents, so as to combine together opposing movements
with contrary dispositions and natures: and
that the aggregate of this whole indispensably requires
a supreme bestower of connection, a blender
and creator: also that whatever this bestower of
relation wills, and this all perfect in wisdom does,
cannot be destitute of utility and wisdom: Máhábád
therefore dispatched persons to all quarters and
regions of the world, to select from land and water
all productions and medicinal plants held in esteem
for their various properties; these he planted in a
proper site, so that by the aid of the terrene and
aqueous particles, the influence of atmospheric
temperature, in conjunction with the sidereal energies,
their powers of vegetation, nutritious qualities,
and properties might be ascertained. At the time
of promulgating this excellent purpose, the sovereign
of the starry host entered in glory the mansion
of Aries; and the rapidly-sketching painter of destiny
drew forth the faces of the brides of the gardens
(blossoms and flowers): then, through the
efficacy of command, experiment, and examination,
Máhábád extracted from the various flowers, fruits,
<a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 17</span>
leaves and fibres, the different alimentary substances,
medicinal compounds, viands and beverages. He
next commanded all sorts of ores to be fetched from
the mines and liquified in the furnace, so that the
different metals concealed in them became visible.
Out of iron, which combines hardness and sharpness,
he formed warlike weapons for the brave;
jewels, gold, silver, rubies, sapphires, diamonds,
and chrysolithes, in which he observed smoothness
and capability of polish, he assigned as decorations
for kings, military chieftains, and matrons.
He also ordered persons to descend into the deep
waters and bring forth the shells, pearls, corals, etc.
People were commanded to shear the fleece of sheep
and other animals: by him also were invented the
arts of spinning, weaving, cutting up, sewing and
clothing. He next organized cities, villages, and
streets; erected palaces and colonnades; introduced
trade and commerce; and divided mankind into four
classes. The first was composed of <span class="title">Hírbeds</span>,
<span class="title">Mobeds</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_233" id="fnanchor_233"></a><a href="#footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></span>
<a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 18</span>
ascetics, and learned men, selected for maintaining
the faith and enforcing the sentence of the laws:
these are also called <span class="title">Birman</span> and
<span class="title">Birmun</span>;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_234" id="fnanchor_234"></a><a href="#footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></span> that is,
they resemble the <span class="title">Barínían</span> or supreme beings, the
exalted angels: they also style them
<span class="title">Húristár</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_235" id="fnanchor_235"></a><a href="#footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></span>
The second class consists of kings and intrepid warriors,
who devote themselves to the cares of government
and authority, to the promotion of equity and
the curbing of oppression; those they call <span class="title">Chatramán</span>,
<span class="title">Chatraman</span>, and
<span class="title">Chatrí</span>:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_236" id="fnanchor_236"></a><a href="#footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></span>
this word <dfn>Chatrí</dfn>
means a standard or distinction; as people of high
rank have a <dfn>Chatra</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_237" id="fnanchor_237"></a><a href="#footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></span>
or umbrella, to protect them
<a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 19</span>
with its shade, which they call <span class="title">Sayah dar</span> and <span class="title">Sayah
ban</span>; the people repose under the shade of the individuals
of this class, who are also called <span class="title">Núristár</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_238" id="fnanchor_238"></a><a href="#footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></span>
The third class is composed of husbandmen, cultivators,
artisans, skilful men, and mechanics; these
are called <span class="title">Bás</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_239" id="fnanchor_239"></a><a href="#footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></span>
which is synonymous with <dfn>Bisyár</dfn>
or numerous; as this class should far exceed in
number all the others. <dfn>Bás</dfn> also means cultivation
and improvement, results which altogether depend
on this order&mdash;they are also styled <span class="title">Suristár</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_240" id="fnanchor_240"></a><a href="#footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></span> The
fourth class are destined for every kind of employment
and service; they are called <dfn>Súdín</dfn>, <dfn>Súdí</dfn>, and
<dfn>Súd</dfn>:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_241" id="fnanchor_241"></a><a href="#footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></span>
from them profit, indulgence, and ease accrue
to society: they are also called <span class="title">Rúzistar</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_242" id="fnanchor_242"></a><a href="#footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></span>
He instituted
these four classes,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_243" id="fnanchor_243"></a><a href="#footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></span>
the four elements of society,
<a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 20</span>
and the sources of organization were completed;
independence and want appeared; there were produced
the gradations of ruler and subject; of lord
and servant; discipline and authority; justice and
knowledge; kindness and severity; protection of the
<dfn>Zindbar</dfn> or kind treatment of innoxious creatures;
destruction of the <dfn>Tundbar</dfn> or noxious animals; the
knowledge of God and the ceremonies of his worship.</p>

<p>God also sent <span class="title">Abád</span> a code called the
<span class="title">Dasátir</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_244" id="fnanchor_244"></a><a href="#footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></span>
<a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 21</span>
in which are formed all languages and sciences.
This work consisted of several volumes, containing
a certain number for each dialect. In it was also
the language called <dfn>Asmání</dfn>, or the Celestial, not a
trace of which has remained in any of the languages
spoken by the inhabitants of this lower world.
<span class="title">Abád</span> also assigned a language to every nation, and
settled each in a suitable place: and thus were produced
the Parsi, Hindi, Greek and such like.</p>

<p>According to this sect, authentic revelation is only
obtained by the world of ecstacy or similitude, called
<span class="title">Mánistán</span>; but from the time of
<span class="title">Máhábád</span>, all the prophets
who were sent were in accordance with his
faith; not one of them being opposed to his law.
After <span class="title">Máhábád</span>, appeared thirteen apostles who, with
him, were styled the fourteen <span class="title">Máhábáds</span>: they were
called by the common name of <span class="title">Abád</span>, and acted on
every occasion in conformity to their ancestor and
his Celestial Code: and whatever revelation was
made to them tended to corroborate the faith of
<span class="title">Máhábád</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_245" id="fnanchor_245"></a><a href="#footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></span>
After them, their sons in due succession
obtained sovereign power, after their fathers, and
devoted themselves to justice. The followers of this
<a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 22</span>
sect also believe that all the prophets and kings were
selected from the heads of the most distinguished
families.</p>

<p>Next to this dynasty, known as the Mahabadian,
comes <span class="person">Abád Azád</span>, who withdrew from temporal
power and walked in the path of devotion and seclusion.
It is recorded, that in their time, the realm
was highly cultivated; treasures were abundant; lofty
palaces, ornamented with paintings and exciting
admiration; colonnades attracting the heart; the
Mobeds celebrated, profoundly learned, worshippers
of God, undefiled, equally eminent in good words
and deeds; soldiers, well-appointed and disciplined,
with corresponding trains of attendants and officers;
mountain-resembling elephants; chargers like fragments
of <dfn>Alburz</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_246" id="fnanchor_246"></a><a href="#footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></span>
rapid in their course; swift-paced
animals for riding; numerous camels and dromedaries;
well-trained cavalry and infantry, and
leaders who had experience in the world; precious
stuffs; vases of gold and silver; thrones and crowns
of great price; heart-delighting tapestries and gardens
with other such objects, the like of which exists
not at present, and were not recorded as being in
<a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 23</span>
existence in the treasures or reigns of the <span class="title">Gilsháíán</span>
monarchs.</p>

<p>However, on the mere abandonment of the crown
by <span class="person">Abád Azád</span>, every thing went to ruin; so much
blood was shed that the mills were turned by streams
of gore; all that had been accomplished by the inventions
and discoveries of this fortunate race was forgotten;
men became like savage and ferocious beasts,
and as in former times resumed their abodes in the
mountain-clefts and gloomy caverns; those superior
in strength overpowered and oppressed the weaker.
At last some of the sages eminent for praise-worthy
language and deeds, and who possessed the volume
of Máhábád, assembled and went into the presence
of <span class="person">Jai Afrám</span>, the son of Abád, who, next his sire
was the most undefiled and intelligent of men, and
became one of the great Apostles: he passed his
time in a mountain cave, far removed from intercourse
with the world, and was styled <dfn>Jai</dfn> on account
of his purity, as in the <span class="title">Abádí</span> or <span class="title">Azárí</span> language, a
holy person is called
<dfn>Jai</dfn>:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_247" id="fnanchor_247"></a><a href="#footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></span>
the assembled sages with
one voice implored his justice, saying: “We know
of no remedy for preserving the world from ruin,
excepting the intercourse of thy noble nature with
mankind.” They afterwards recited to him the
<a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 24</span>
counsels, testamentary precepts, traditions and memorials
of the <span class="title">Abádíán</span> princes on the great merit of
this undertaking. He did not however assent, until
a divine command had reached him, when through
the influence of revelation and the presence of the
decree-bearing angel, <span class="title">Gabriel</span>, he arose and assumed
the high dignity, The realm once more flourished,
and the institutes of <span class="title">Abád</span> resumed their former
vigor. The last of the fortunate monarchs of the
<span class="title">Jaí</span> dynasty was <span class="person">Jaí Alád</span>, who also retired from
mankind; when the dominion had remained in this
family during one <span class="title">aspár</span> of years. It is written in
books of high authority that <span class="person">Jaí Afrám</span> was called
the son of <span class="person">Abád Azád</span>, because next to his noble
ancestor no individual possessed such great perfections:
but in reality many generations intervened
between them: besides, <span class="person">Jaí Afrám</span> was descended
from the sons of <span class="person">Abád Azád</span>, so that there is a wide
interval between <span class="person">Sháí Gilív</span> and <span class="person">Jaí Abád</span>: in like
manner between <span class="person">Sháí Mahbúl</span> and <span class="person">Yásán</span>, and between
<span class="person">Yásán</span> and <span class="person">Gilsháhí</span> there must have elapsed
multiplied and numerous generations.</p>

<p>Those who would understand the doctrines of this
faith must know, the process of numeration among
this profoundly-thinking sect is as follows; by tens,
hundreds and thousands: one <dfn>salám</dfn> equal to one
hundred thousand; one hundred salám, one <dfn>shamár</dfn>;
one hundred <dfn>shámar</dfn>, one <dfn>aspár</dfn>; one hundred <dfn>aspár</dfn>,
<a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 25</span>
one <dfn>rádah</dfn>; one hundred <dfn>rádah</dfn>, one <dfn>arádah</dfn>; a hundred
<dfn>arádah</dfn>, one <dfn>ráz</dfn>; a hundred <dfn>ráz</dfn>, one <dfn>aráz</dfn>;
and a hundred <dfn>aráz</dfn>, one <dfn>bíáraz</dfn>.</p>

<p>Now that their system of computation has been
explained, I shall proceed with their history. They
say that when his attendants found not the auspicious
monarch <span class="person">Jaí Alád</span>, neither amongst his courtiers,
nor in the royal apartments, or <dfn>harem</dfn>, nor in
the house of praise, or place of prayer, the affairs of
the human race fell once more into disorder: at
length the sages and holy men went and represented
the state of affairs to the praise-worthy apostle <span class="person">Sháí
Gilív</span>, son of <span class="person">Jáí Alád</span>, who was then engaged in the
worship of the Almighty. This prince, from his
great devotion and unceasing adoration rendered to
God, was called <span class="title">Sháí</span> and <span class="title">Sháyí</span>, that is a god and a
God-worshipper: his sons were therefore styled
<span class="title">Sháyián</span>. When the sages had stated the case, the
first <span class="title">Sháyíán</span> prince, <span class="person">Sháí Gilív</span>, having reflected on
the cruelty practised towards the animal creation,
arose, through the influence of a celestial revelation
and Divine light, and sat in his illustrious father’s
throne. After this happy dynasty came <span class="person">Sháí Mahbúl</span>,
when the <span class="title">Sháíyán</span> empire had lasted one <dfn>shamár</dfn>
of years.</p>

<p>After these came the <span class="title">Yásánián</span>, so called from
<span class="person">Yásán</span>, the son of <span class="person">Sháí Mahbúl</span>: this prince was
exceeding wise, intelligent, holy and celebrated; the
<a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 26</span>
apostle of the age: and being in every respect worthy
of supreme power, was therefore called <span class="title">Yásán</span>, or the
meritorious and justly
exalted.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_248" id="fnanchor_248"></a><a href="#footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></span>
His mighty sire
having withdrawn from mankind, retired into seclusion,
and there giving himself entirely up to the
worship of God, the affairs of the human race again
relapsed into disorder. Tradition informs us, that
when these auspicious prophets and their successors
beheld evil to prevail amongst mankind, they invariably
withdrew from among them&mdash;as they could
not endure to behold or hear wickedness; and sin
had no admission to their breasts. When the chain
of worldly repose had been rent asunder, Yasán, in
obedience to a Divine revelation, seated himself on
the throne of sovereignty, and overthrew evil. Of
this happy dynasty the last was <span class="title">Yásán Ajám</span>, when
this admirable family had graced the throne during
ninety and nine <span class="title">salám</span> of years. The author of the
<span class="title">Amíghistán</span> says: “The years which I have mentioned
are <dfn>farsáls</dfn> of Saturn: one revolution of the
regent Saturn, which is allowed to be thirty years,
they call one day; thirty such days, one month; and
twelve such months, one year.” This is the rule
observed by the <span class="title">Yezdánián</span>, who write down the
various years of the seven planets after this manner:
<a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 27</span>
such is the amount of the saturnian <dfn>farsál</dfn>. This
same system of computation is applied to the <dfn>farsáls</dfn>
of Mars, Venus, Mercury and the moon, a day of
each being the time of their respective revolutions:
they at the same time retain the use of the ordinary
lunar and solar months.</p>

<p>It is also to be observed that, according to them,
the year is of two kinds; one the <dfn>farsál</dfn>, which is
after this manner: when the planet has traversed
the twelve mansions of the zodiac, they call it one
day; thirty such days, one month; and twelve such
months, one year; as we have before explained under
Saturn. Similar years constitute the <dfn>farsáls</dfn> of the
other planets, which they thus enumerate; the <dfn>farsáls</dfn>
of Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the sun, Venus, Mercury,
and the moon: the months of the <dfn>farsál</dfn> they
call <dfn>farmáh</dfn>; the days of the farmáh, <dfn>farróz</dfn>. The
second kind of years is, when Saturn in the period of
thirty years traverses the twelve mansions, which
they call a saturnian <dfn>karsál</dfn>; the <dfn>karmáh</dfn> is his remaining
two years and a half in each mansion,&mdash;Jupiter
describes his period in twelve common years;
this time they call the <dfn>hormuzí karsál</dfn>; and the <dfn>hormuzí
karmáh</dfn> is his remaining one year in each mansion:
and so with regard to the others. However,
when we speak of years or months in the accounts
given of the <span class="title">Gilsháíyán</span> princes, solar and lunar
years and months are always meant; day implies the
<a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 28</span>
acknowledged day; and by month is meant the residence
of the Great Light in one of the zodiacal mansions;
and by year, his passing through the zodiac;
a lunar month is its complete revolution, and traversing
all the signs, which year and month are also
called <dfn>Tímúr</dfn>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_249" id="fnanchor_249"></a><a href="#footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>When Yásán Asám had abandoned this elementary
body and passed away from this abode of
wickedness, the state of mankind fell into utter
ruin, as his son <span class="person">Gilsháh</span>, who was enlightened in
spirit, intelligent in nature, adorned by good deeds,
feeling no wish for sovereign power, had given
himself so entirely up to the service of God, that
no one knew the retreat of this holy personage.&mdash;Men
therefore, shutting up the eyes of social intercourse,
extended the arm of oppression against each
other; at once the lofty battlements and noble edifices
were levelled to the ground; the deep fosses
filled up; mankind being left destitute of a head, the
bonds of society were broken; slaughter was carried
to such excess, that numerous rivers flowed
with currents of blood, streaming from the bodies of
the slain: in a short time not a trace was left of the
countless treasures and the boundless stores, the
amount of which defied the computations of imagination.
Matters even came to such an extremity, that
<a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 29</span>
men threw off the institutes of humanity, and were
no longer capable of distinguishing the relative values
of precious stones, wares and commodities: they left
not a vestige remaining of palaces and cities; but
like ferocious and savage beasts, took up their dwelling
in the mountain caverns.&mdash;Besides this, they
fought against each other, so that the multitudes of
the human race were reduced to a scanty remnant.</p>

<p>On this, <span class="title">Gilsháh</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_250" id="fnanchor_250"></a><a href="#footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></span>
of exalted nature, in obedience to
a revelation from heaven, and to the command of the
ruler of the universe, became the sovereign of mankind:
he restored the institutes of justice, and reassembled
the members of his family, who, during his
seclusion, had totally dispersed: on this account he
was styled <span class="title">Abú-l-Bashr</span>, or “the Father of the human
race,” because with the exception of his family,
the great majority of the others having fallen in their
mutual contests, the survivors had adopted the pursuits
and habitudes of demons and of wild beasts:
<span class="person">Kaiomors</span>, or <span class="person">Gilsháh</span>, with his sons, then proceeded
to give battle to the vile race, and disabled their
<a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 30</span>
hands from inflicting cruelty on the harmless animals:
all that we find in Histories of Kaiomors, and
his sons fighting against demons, refers to this circumstance,
and the systems of faith which sanction
the slaughter of animals were all invented by this
demon-like race. In short, the only true Ruler of
the world transmitted a celestial volume to Kaiomors,
and also selected for the prophetic office
among his illustrious descendants, <span class="person">Siyámak</span>, <span class="person">Húsháng</span>,
<span class="person">Tahmúras</span>, <span class="person">Jemshíd</span>,
<span class="person">Farídún</span>, <span class="person">Minucheher</span>,
<span class="person">Kai Khúsró</span>, <span class="person">Zaratúsht</span>,
<span class="person">Azár Sásán</span> the first, and
<span class="person">Azár Sásán</span> the fifth, enjoining them to walk in conformity
with the doctrines of Máhábád and Kaiomors;
so that the celestial volumes which he bestowed
on those happy princes, all their writings
and records were in perfect accord with the code of
<span class="title">Máhábád</span>: with the exception of <span class="person">Zaratúsht</span>, not one
of this race uttered a single word against the book
of Abad: and even Zaratúsht’s words were, by the
glosses of the <span class="title">Yezdániáns</span>, made to conform to the
<span class="title">Máhábádian</span> code&mdash;they therefore style Zaratúsht,
“<dfn>Wakhshur-i-Simbari</dfn>,” or the parable-speaking
prophet.</p>

<p>The Gilsháían monarchs constitute four races;
namely, the <span class="title">Peshdádían</span>, <span class="title">Kaiánián</span>,
<span class="title">Ashkánián</span>, and
<span class="title">Sásáníán</span>: the last of these kings is
<span class="person">Yezdejird</span>, the son
of <span class="person">Sheriar</span>: the empire of these auspicious sovereigns
lasted six thousand and twenty-four years and five
<a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 31</span>
months.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_251" id="fnanchor_251"></a><a href="#footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></span>
During their existence, the world was
arrayed in beauty: <span class="person">Kaiomors</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_252" id="fnanchor_252"></a><a href="#footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></span>
<span class="person">Siyamak</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_253" id="fnanchor_253"></a><a href="#footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></span>
<span class="person">Húshang</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_254" id="fnanchor_254"></a><a href="#footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></span>

<span class="person">Tahmúras</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_255" id="fnanchor_255"></a><a href="#footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></span>
surnamed the
Enslaver of Demons, and <span class="person">Jemshid</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_256" id="fnanchor_256"></a><a href="#footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></span>
through celestial
<a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 32</span>
revelations, Divine assistance, the instruction of
Almighty God, unerring prudence, and just views,
having followed in all things what we have recorded
concerning Máhábád and his illustrious children,
introduced the rules of Divine worship, the knowledge
of God, virtuous deeds, purity of conduct,
modes of diet, clothing, the rites of marriage, the
observance of continence, with all kinds of science,
letters, books, professions, solemn festivals, banquets,
wind and stringed musical instruments, cities,
gardens, palaces, ornaments, arms, gradations of
office, the distinctions of the two sexes with respect
to exposure and privacy, the diffusion of equity, justice,
and all that was praiseworthy.</p>

<p>After these, the Gilsháiyán ruled, through divine
inspiration and the communication of the Almighty
added to their intelligence, so that the greater part
of the splendor, pomp, and beauty we now behold
in the world is to be attributed to this happy race:
many however of the excellent institutions of this
happy dynasty have fallen into disuse and a few
only remain.</p>

<p>The following is the sum of the <span class="title">Sipásián</span> creed:
from the commencement of <span class="title">Máhábád’s</span> empire to the
<a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 33</span>
end of <span class="person">Yezdejird</span>’s reign, the great majority, nay all
the individuals of this chosen race, with the exception
of <span class="person">Zokah</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_257" id="fnanchor_257"></a><a href="#footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></span>
were models of equity, characterized
by justice and piety, perfect in words and deeds.
In this holy family, some were prophets, all were
saints, righteous and God-fearing persons, with
realms and armies maintained in the highest order.
They also acknowledge the apostles and princes
prior to <span class="person">Gilsháh</span>, from <span class="title">Máhábád</span>
to <span class="person">Yásán Ajám</span>, as so
eminently pious, that in no degree whatever did wickedness
enter into their conversation or actions: nor
did they at any time deviate from the <dfn>Paymán-i-Farhang</dfn>,
or “Excellent Covenant,” which is the code
of Máhábád, nor omit the performance of any duty;
they also held that the stars are exceedingly exalted,
and constitute the
<dfn>Kiblah</dfn><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_258" id="fnanchor_258"></a><a href="#footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></span>
of the inhabitants of this
lower world.</p>

<p><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 34</span>
In the time of <span class="person">Dáwir Háryár</span> (the author of Daraí
Sekander), who was of the <span class="title">Kaíánian</span> race and a follower
of the <span class="title">Yezdanian</span> faith, some one said: “The
prophets and faith are higher in dignity than the
sun.” <span class="person">Dawir</span> replied: “Where are now the forms
and bodies of that description of men?” On
which that person having stated the names of the cities
and burial places of the prophets, <span class="person">Dawir</span> rejoined:
“During their whole lifetime, the form of no prophet
or saint ever emitted light, even the distance
of one day’s journey, and since they have been
committed to the earth, not a single ray has been
shed from their graves: and they are now so
blended with the dust that not a trace of them is
left!” The person then said: “the spirits of the
prophets and saints are exceedingly resplendent.”
<span class="person">Dawir</span> retorted: “Behold what amount of light is
diffused by the solar globe! whereas the bodies of
your saints are destitute of splendor; therefore
rest assured that his spirit is more resplendent
than theirs.&mdash;Know besides, that the sun is the
heart of the heavens: if he existed not, this world
of formation and dissolution could not continue:
he brings forth the seasons and the productive
energies of nature; moreover, the prophets were
not in the beginning, nor are they in existence
<a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 35</span>
now: but the world endures, the seasons rejoice,
and the people are gladdened: this much however
may be conceded, that the prophets and
saints are more exalted than the remainder of the
human race.”&mdash;On hearing this, that person was
silenced. Lastly, it is stated in the <span class="title">Akhtaristán</span>,
that the Sipásíán tenets were, that the stars and
the heavens are the shadows of the incorporeal
effulgences; on this account they erected the temples
of the seven planets, and had talismans formed
of metal or stone, suitable to each star: all which
talismans were placed in their proper abode, under
a suitable aspect: they also set apart a portion
of time for their worship and handed down the
mode of serving them. When they performed the
rites to these holy statues, they burned before them
the suitable incense at the appointed season, and
held their power in high veneration. Their temples
were called <dfn>Paikaristan</dfn>, or “image-temples,”
and <dfn>Shidistán</dfn>, or “the abodes of the forms of the luminous
bodies.”</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Description of the worship rendered to the seven
planets according to the Sipasian faith.</span>&mdash;It is stated
in the <span class="title">Akhtaristán</span>, that the image of the regent
Saturn was cut out of black stone, in a human shape,
with an ape-like head; his body like a man’s, with
a hog’s tail, and a crown on his head; in the right
<a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 36</span>
hand a sieve; in the left a serpent. His temple was
also of black stone, and his officiating ministers were
negroes, Abyssinians and persons of black complexions:
they wore blue garments, and on their
fingers rings of iron: they offered up storax and
such like perfumes, and generally dressed and offered
up pungent viands; they administered myrobalam,
also similar gums and drugs. Villagers and husbandmen
who had left their abodes, nobles, doctors,
anchorites, mathematicians, enchanters, soothsayers
and persons of that description lived in the
vicinity of this temple, where these sciences were
taught, and their maintenance allowed them: they
first paid adoration in the temple and afterwards
waited on the king. All persons ranked among the
servants of the regent Saturn were presented to the
king through the medium of the chiefs and officers
of this temple, who were always selected from the
greatest families in Iran. The words <dfn>Shat</dfn> and <dfn>Tímsar</dfn>
are appellations of honor, signifying dignity,
just as <dfn>Sri</dfn> in Hindi, and <dfn>Hazrat</dfn> in Arabic.</p>

<p>The image of the regent <span class="title">Hormuzd</span> (Jupiter) was of an
earthy color, in the shape of a man, with a
vulture’s<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_259" id="fnanchor_259"></a><a href="#footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></span>
face: on his head a crown, on which were the faces of
a cock and a dragon; in the right hand a turban; in
the left a crystal ewer. The ministers of this temple
<a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 37</span>
were of a terrene hue, dressed in yellow and white;
they wore rings of silver and signets of cornelian;
the incense consisted of laurel-berries and such like;
the viands prepared by them were sweet. Learned
men, judges, imans, eminent vizirs, distinguished
men, nobles, magistrates and scribes dwelt in the
street attached to this temple, where they devoted
themselves to their peculiar pursuits, but principally
giving themselves up to the science of theology.</p>

<p>The temple of the regent
<span class="title">Bahram</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_260" id="fnanchor_260"></a><a href="#footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></span>
(Mars) and his
image were of red stone: he was represented in a
human form, wearing on his head a red crown: his
right hand was of the same color and hanging down;
his left, yellow and raised up: in the right was a
blood-stained sword, and an iron verge in the left.
The ministers of this temple were dressed in red
garments; his attendants were Turks with rings of
copper on their hands; the fumigations made before
him consisted of sandaracha and such like; the
viands used here were bitter. Princes, champions,
soldiers, military men, and Turks dwelt in his street.
Persons of this description, through the agency of
the directors of the temple, were admitted to the
king’s presence. The bestowers of charity dwelt
in the vicinity of this temple; capital punishments
were here inflicted, and the prison for criminals
was also in that street.</p>

<p><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 38</span>
The image of the world-enlightening solar regent
was the largest of the idols; his dome was built of
gold-plated bricks: the interior inlaid with rubies,
diamonds, cornelian and such like. The image of
the Great Light was formed of burnished gold, in
the likeness of a man with two heads, on each of
which was a precious crown set with rubies; and
in each diadem were seven <dfn>sárún</dfn> or peaks. He was
seated on a powerful steed; his face resembling that
of a man, but he had a dragon’s tail; in the right
hand a rod of gold, a collar of diamonds around his
neck. The ministers of this temple were dressed in
yellow robes of gold tissue, and a girdle set with
rubies, diamonds, and other solar stones: the fumigations
consisted of sandal wood and such like: they
generally served up acid viands. In his quarter
were the families of kings and emperors, chiefs,
men of might, nobles, chieftains, governors, rulers
of countries, and men of science: visitors of this
description were introduced to the king by the chiefs
of the temple.</p>

<p>The exterior of <span class="title">Nahid’s</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_261" id="fnanchor_261"></a><a href="#footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></span>
(Venus) temple was of
white marble and the interior of crystal: the form
of the idol was that of a red man, wearing a seven-peaked
crown on the head: in the right hand a flask
of oil, and in the left a comb: before him was burnt
saffron and such like; his ministers were clad in
<a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 39</span>
white, fine robes, and wore pearl-studded crowns,
and diamond rings on their fingers. Men were not
permitted to enter this temple at night. Matrons
and their daughters performed the necessary offices
and service, except on the night of the king’s going
there, as then no females approached, but men only
had access to it. Here the ministering attendants
served up rich viands. Ladies of the highest rank,
practising austerities, worshippers of God, belonging
to the place or who came from a distance, goldsmiths,
painters and musicians dwelt around this
temple, through the chiefs and directors of which
they were presented to the king: but the women
and ladies of rank were introduced to the queen by
the female directresses of the temple.</p>

<p>The dome and image of the regent
<span class="title">Tir</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_262" id="fnanchor_262"></a><a href="#footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></span>
(Mercury)
was of blue stone; his body that of a fish, with a
boar’s face: one arm black, the other white; on his
head a crown: he had a tail like that of a fish; in
his right hand a pen, and in the left an inkhorn.
The substances burnt in this temple were gum mastic
and the like. His ministers were clad in blue,
wearing on their fingers rings of gold. At their
feasts they served up acidulous viands. Vizirs, philosophers,
astrologers, physicians, farriers, accountants,
revenue-collectors, ministers, secretaries, merchants,
architects, tailors, fine writers and such like,
<a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 40</span>
were stationed there, and through the agency of the
directors of the temple, had access to the king: the
knowledge requisite for such sciences and pursuits
was also communicated there.</p>

<p>The temple of the regent <span class="title">Mah</span> (the moon) was
of a green stone; his image that of a man seated on
a white ox: on his head a diadem in the front of
which were three peaks: on the hands were bracelets,
and a collar around the neck. In his right
hand an amulet of rubies, and in the left a branch
of sweet basil: his ministers were clad in green and
white, and wore rings of silver. The substances
burnt before this image were gum arabic and such
like drugs. His attendants served up salted viands.
Spies, ambassadors, couriers, news-reporters, voyagers,
and the generality of travellers, and such like
persons resided in his street, and were presented to
the king through the directors of the temple. Besides
the peculiar ministers and attendants, there
were attached to each temple several royal commissioners
and officers, engaged in the execution of the
king’s orders; and in such matters as were connected
with the image in that temple. In the <dfn>Khuristar</dfn>
or “refectory of each temple,” the board was
spread the whole day with various kinds of viands
and beverages always ready. No one was repulsed,
so that whoever chose partook of them. In like
manner, in the quarter adjacent to each temple, was
<a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 41</span>
an hospital, where the sick under the idol’s protection
were attended by the physician of that hospital.
Thus there were also places provided for travellers,
who on their arrival in the city repaired to
the quarter appropriated to the temple to which
they belonged.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_263" id="fnanchor_263"></a><a href="#footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>It is to be observed, that although the planets are
simple bodies of a spherical form, yet the reason
why the above-mentioned images have been thus
formed, is that the planetary spirits have appeared
in the world of imagination to certain prophets,
saints, and holy sages under such forms; and under
which they are also connected with certain influences;
and as they have appeared under forms different
from these to other persons, their images
have also been made after that fashion.</p>

<p><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 42</span>
When the great king, his nobles, retinue and the
other Yezdanian went to the temple of Saturn, they
were arrayed in robes of blue and black hues; expressed
themselves with humility, moving with a
slow pace, their hands folded on the breast. In the
temple of <span class="title">Hormuzd</span> (Jupiter), they were dressed in
his colors, as learned men and judges. In that of
<span class="title">Bahram</span> (Mars) they were clad in the robes peculiar
to him, and expressed themselves in an arrogant
manner&mdash;but in the temple of the Sun, in language
suitable to kings and holy persons; in that of Venus,
they appeared cheerful and smiling; in the temple
of Mercury they spoke after the manner of sages and
orators; and in the moon’s, like young children and
inferior officers.</p>

<p>In every private house there were besides images
of the stars, a minute description of which is given
in the <span class="title">Akhtaristan</span>. They had also, in every temple,
the spherical or true forms of the several
planets.</p>

<p>There was a city called the royal abode or <dfn>saráí</dfn>,
facing which were seven temples. On each day of
the week, in the dress appropriated to each planet,
the king exhibited himself from an elevated <dfn>tabsar</dfn>
or window, fronting the temple of the planet, whilst
the people, in due order and arrangement, offered
up their prayers. For example, on Sunday or
<dfn>Yakshambah</dfn>, he shewed himself clad in a yellow
<a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 43</span>
kabá or tunic of gold tissue, wearing a crown of the
same metal, set with rubies and diamonds, covered
with many ornaments of gold from the tabsar, the
circumference of which was embossed with similar
stones: under this window, the several ranks of the
military were drawn out in due gradation, until the
last line took post in the <dfn>kashúdzár</dfn> or ample area,
in which were posted soldiers of the lowest order.
When the king issued forth, like the sun, from the
orient of the tabsar, all the people prostrated themselves
in adoration, and the monarch devoted himself
to the concerns of mankind. The <dfn>Tábsár</dfn> is a
place of observation in a lofty pavilion, which the
princes of Hindustan call a <dfn>jahrokah</dfn> or lattice window:
on the other days, the king appeared with similar
brilliancy from the other Tábsárs. In like manner
the king, on their great festivals, went in choice
garments to the temples of the several images: and
on his return seated himself in the Tábsár, facing the
image of the planet, or, having gone to the <span class="title">Rózistán</span>
or <span class="title">Dádistán</span>, devoted himself to the affairs of
state. This Rozistan was a place which had no
tábsár, where the king seated himself on the throne,
his ministers standing around in due gradation.&mdash;The
<dfn>Dádistán</dfn> was the hall of justice, where, when
the king was seated, no one was prevented from
having access to him: so that the king first came to
the Tábsár, then to the rózistán, and lastly to the
<a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 44</span>
Dádistán. Also on whatever day a planet moved
out of one celestial house to another, and on all great
festival days, the king went to the temple appropriate
to the occasion. Each of the planetary forms
had also its peculiar Tábsár, in the same manner as
we have before stated concerning the royal Tábsár;
and on a happy day, or festival, they brought the
image to its Tábsár, The king went first and offered
up prayer, standing in the Tábsár of the image, the
nobles placed around according to their gradations,
whilst the people were assembled in great multitudes
in the <span class="title">Kashúdzár</span>, offering up prayers to the planet.</p>

<p>According to what is stated in the <span class="title">Tímsár
Dasátir</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_264" id="fnanchor_264"></a><a href="#footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></span>
that is, in the “Venerable Desátir,” the Almighty
Creator has so formed the celestial bodies,
that from their motions there result certain effects
in this lower world, and, without doubt, all events
here depend on the movements of these elevated
bodies; so that every star has relation to some event,
and every mansion possesses its peculiar nature:
nay, every degree of each sign is endued with a distinct
influence: therefore the prophets of the Lord,
in conformity to his orders, and by great experience,
<a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 45</span>
have ascertained the properties inherent in the degrees
of each celestial mansion, and the influences
of the stars. It is certain that whenever the agent
does not agree with the passive, the result of the
affair will not be fortunate; consequently, when the
prophets and sages desired that the agency of the
planet should be manifested advantageously in the
world, they carefully noted the moment of the star’s
entering the degree most suitable to the desired
event: and also to have at a distance from that point,
whatever stars were unfavorable to the issue. When
all had been thus arranged, whatever was connected
with the productive cause was then completed: they
then bring together whatever is connected with causation
in the lower world: thus all the viands, perfumes,
colors, forms, and all things relating to the
star, being associated, they enter on the undertaking
with firm faith and sure reliance: and whereas the
spirits possess complete influence over the events
which occur in the lower world, when therefore the
celestial, terrestrial, corporeal and spiritual causes
are all united, the business is then accomplished.
But whosoever desires to be master of these powers,
must be well skilled in metaphysics; in the secrets
of nature; and having his mind well stored with the
knowledge of the planetary influences, and rendered
intelligent by much experience. As the union
of such qualifications is rarely or never found, the
<a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 46</span>
truth of this science is consequently hidden from
men. The <span class="title">Abadián</span> moreover say, that the prophets
of the early faith, or the kings of <span class="place">Farsistán</span> and the
<span class="title">Yezdánián</span>, held the stars to be the <span class="title">Kiblah</span> of prayer,
and always paid them adoration, especially when a
star was in its own house or in its ascendant, free
from evil aspects; they then collected whatever bore
relation to that planet, and engaged in worship,
seating themselves in a suitable place, and suffering
no one to come near them: they practised austerities;
and on the completion of their undertaking, exhibited
kindness to the animal creation.</p>

<p>In the year 1061 of the Hegira (A. D. 1651) the
author, then in <span class="person">Sikakul of
Kalang</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_265" id="fnanchor_265"></a><a href="#footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></span>
was attacked
by a disease which no application could alleviate.
An astrologer pronounced, that “the cause of this
malady arises from the overpowering force of
the regent Mars;” on which, several distinguished
Brahmins assembled on the fourth of <span class="time">Zíkâdah</span> (the
9th October) the same year, and having set out the
image of Bahrám and collected the suitable perfumes,
with all other things fit for the operation,
employed themselves in reading prayers and reciting
names; at last, their chief, taking up with
great reverence the image of Mars, thus entreated:
<a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 47</span>
“O illustrious angel and celestial leader! moderate
thy heat, and be not wrathful: but be merciful to
such a one” (pointing to me). He then plunged the
image into perfumed water; immediately on the
immersion of the image, the pain was removed.</p>

<p>In front of each temple was a large fire-temple,
so that there were seven in all: namely, the <span class="title">Kaiwan-ázar</span>,
<span class="title">Hormuz-ázar</span>, <span class="title">Bahrám-ázar</span>,
<span class="title">Hár-ázar</span>, <span class="title">Nahíd-ázar</span>,
<span class="title">Tír-ázar</span>, and <span class="title">Máh-ázar</span>,
so that each fire-temple
was dedicated to one of the seven planets, and
in these they burnt the proper perfumes. They
assert that, during the flourishing empire of the early
monarchs, several sacred structures, such as those
of the Kâbah and the holy temple of Mecca;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_266" id="fnanchor_266"></a><a href="#footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></span>
Jerusalem;
the burial-place of Muhammed; the asylum
of prophecy, in Medina; the place of repose of
Alí,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_267" id="fnanchor_267"></a><a href="#footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></span>
the prince of the faithful in Najf; the sepulchre
of Imam Husain in Kerbela;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_268" id="fnanchor_268"></a><a href="#footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></span>
the tomb of Imam
<a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 48</span>
Musa<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_269" id="fnanchor_269"></a><a href="#footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></span>
in Baghdad;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_270" id="fnanchor_270"></a><a href="#footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></span>
the mausoleum of Imam Reza<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_271" id="fnanchor_271"></a><a href="#footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></span>
in Sanábád of Tús; and the sanctuary of Alí in
Balkh,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_272" id="fnanchor_272"></a><a href="#footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></span>
were all in former times idol and fire-temples.
They say that Mahabad after having built a
fire temple, called <dfn>Haftsúr</dfn> or seven ramparts, in Istakhar
of Persia,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_273" id="fnanchor_273"></a><a href="#footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></span>
erected a house to which he gave
the name of <span class="title">Abád</span>, and which is at present called the
<span class="title">Kâbah</span>: and which the inhabitants of that country
were commanded to hold in reverence: among the
images of the <span class="title">Kâbah</span> was one of the moon, exceedingly
beautiful, wherefore the temple was called
<span class="title">Máhgáh</span> (Moon’s place) which the Arabs generally
changed into Mekka. They also say that among the
images and statues left in the Kâbah by Mahabad and
<a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 49</span>
his renowned successors, one is the black stone,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_274" id="fnanchor_274"></a><a href="#footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></span>
the emblem of Saturn. They also say that the prophet
of Arabia worshipped the seven planets, and
he therefore left undisturbed the black stone or Saturn’s
emblem, which had remained since the time
of the Abadian dynasty; but that he broke or carried
away the other figures introduced by the Koreish,
and which were not formed according to the
images of the stars. In most of the ancient temples
of Persia they had formed the symbol of Venus in
the figure of a <dfn>Mihrab</dfn>, or arch, like the altar of the
mosques: consequently the present <dfn>Mihrab</dfn>, or altar,
is that identical symbol: which assertion is also
proved by the respect paid to Friday or the day of
Venus.</p>

<p>Ibrahim (Abraham), the friend of God, pursued
the same conduct; that is, he rejected the idols
<a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 50</span>
which were not of the planetary forms: and the
reverence paid by him to the black stone, according
to ancient tradition, seems to prove that point.
<span class="person">Isfendiar</span>, the son of king
<span class="person">Gushtasp</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_275" id="fnanchor_275"></a><a href="#footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></span>
conformed also
to this practice; nay Socrates the Sage, in like manner,
forbad the people to worship any other forms
except those of the planets, and commanded the
statues of the kings to be removed. Moreover, the
holy temple of Jerusalem, or
<span class="title">Kundízh-húhkt</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_276" id="fnanchor_276"></a><a href="#footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></span> was
erected by Zohak, and Faridun<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_277" id="fnanchor_277"></a><a href="#footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></span>
kindled in it the
holy fire. But long before Zohak’s time, there were
several idol and fire temples in that place. In the
same manner, they say, that when Faridoon turned
his attention to the overthrow of Zohak, during his
journey his brethren having hurled a rock at him,
this revered prince, who was skilled and mighty in
<a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 51</span>
all the extraordinary sciences, manifested a wonderous
deed: he prayed to the Almighty that it
might remain suspended in the air, so that the stone
even to this day is known as <span class="title">Kúds Khalíl</span>. They
also say that in <span class="place">Medina</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_278" id="fnanchor_278"></a><a href="#footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></span>
the burial place of the prophet,
there was formerly an image of the moon: the
temple in which it was, they called <dfn>Mahdínah</dfn>, or the
“Moon of Religion,” as religion is the moon of
truth, from which the Arabs formed <span class="title">Medinah</span>.
They in like manner relate, that in the most noble
<span class="place">Najf</span>, where now is the shrine of Alí, the prince of
the faithful, there was formerly a fire-temple called
<span class="title">Farógh pírái</span> (the decoration of splendor), and also
“<span class="title">Nakaf</span>,” or <span class="title">Na akaft</span> (no injury), which is at present
denominated <span class="title">Najf</span>. Also at <span class="place">Karbalá</span>, the place where
the Imam Husain reposes, there was formerly a fire-temple
called <span class="title">Mahyársur
ilm</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_279" id="fnanchor_279"></a><a href="#footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></span>
and <dfn>Kar bala</dfn> (sublime
agency), at present called <span class="title">Karbela</span>.</p>

<p>Also in Baghdad, where the Imam Musa reposes,
was a fire-temple called <span class="title">Shet Piráyi</span> (decoration): and
in the place where rest the remains of the great
Imam <span class="person">Abu Hanifah</span>, of Kufah, was a temple called
<dfn>Húryar</dfn> (sun’s friend): also in Kufah, on the site of the
<a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 52</span>
mosque, was a fire-temple called <span class="title">Roz-Azar</span> (the day
of fire): and in the region of Tús, on the site of Imam
Resa’s shrine, was a fire-temple called <span class="title">Azar Khirad</span>
(the fire of intellect)&mdash;it was also known by many
other appellations, and owes its erection to Faridún.&mdash;Also
when <span class="person">Tús</span>, the son of
<span class="person">Názar</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_280" id="fnanchor_280"></a><a href="#footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></span>
came to
visit <span class="person">Azar-i-Khirad</span>, he laid near it the foundation of a
city which was called after his name.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_281" id="fnanchor_281"></a><a href="#footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></span>&mdash;In
Balkh,
where is now the sanctuary of the Imam, formerly
stood a temple called <dfn>Mahin Azar</dfn> (great fire), now
known under the name of <span class="title">Nóbahár</span>. In Ardebil,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_282" id="fnanchor_282"></a><a href="#footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></span>
the ancient <dfn>Dizh-i-Bahman</dfn><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_283" id="fnanchor_283"></a><a href="#footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></span>
(Bahman’s fort), Kai
Khosrú, on reducing the citadel, constructed there
a fire-temple called <span class="title">Azari-Káus</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_284" id="fnanchor_284"></a><a href="#footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></span>
which now serves
as the burial place of the shaikh Sufi Ud-Din, the
ancestor of the Safavean princes:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_285" id="fnanchor_285"></a><a href="#footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></span>
they also assert
<a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 53</span>
that there were fire-temples in several parts of India:
as in <span class="place">Dwaraka</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_286" id="fnanchor_286"></a><a href="#footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></span>
was the temple of Saturn,
called <dfn>Dizh-i-Kaivan</dfn> (Saturn’s fort), which the Hindoos
turned into <span class="title">Dwaraka</span>: and in Gya also was an
idol temple, called <dfn>Gah-i-Kaivan</dfn>, or “Saturn’s residence,”
which was turned into
Gya.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_287" id="fnanchor_287"></a><a href="#footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></span>&mdash;In
Mahtra
also was an idol temple of Saturn, the name of
which was <span class="title">Mahetar</span>, that is the chiefs or <dfn>mahetar</dfn>
resorted thither; which word by degrees became
<span class="title">Mahtra</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_288" id="fnanchor_288"></a><a href="#footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></span>&mdash;In
like manner several places among
<a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 54</span>
the Christians and other nations bore names which
show them to have been idol-temples. When the
<span class="title">Abadian</span> come to such places, they visit them with
the accustomed reverence, as, according to them
holy places are never liable to abomination or pollution,
as they still remain places of worship and
adoration: both friends and foes regarding them as
a Kiblah, and sinners, notwithstanding all their
perverseness, pray in those sacred edifices. Rai
Gópí Nath<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_289" id="fnanchor_289"></a><a href="#footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></span>
thus expresses himself:</p>

<div class="poem-container">

<p>There is not on record a single word repugnant
to reason from the time of Mahabad to that of Yasan
Ajam; and if they have recourse to allegory, they
then express its figurative nature. From these
princes to the Gilshaiyan there are many figurative
expressions, all of which they interpret. For example,
they say that the tradition of Siamak being
slain by the hand of a demon implies, that in successive
battles, through ignorance of himself and
God, he unwittingly destroyed this elementary body;
thus, wherever, in the language of this sect, mention
<a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 55</span>
is made of a demon, they always understand a man
of that description, as has been explained in the
<span class="title">Paiman-i-ferhang</span>, or “Excellent Code.” They also
maintain that, in some passages, the rendering the
demons obedient, and slaying them, is a figurative
mode of expressing a victory gained over the pleasures
of sense, and the extirpation of evil propensities:
in like manner, whatever is related about the
appearance of angels to virtuous and holy persons,
is the revelation and vision of good spirits, whilst in
a state of sleep, transport, recovery from excess, or
abstraction from the body; which states are truly
explained in this work. They say that Zohak’s two
serpents, <span class="title">do-mar</span>, and ten fires (vices) or <span class="title">deh ak</span>,
imply irascibility and sensuality: the devil, his carnal
soul, and in some places his disposition&mdash;the
two pieces of flesh which broke out on Zohak’s
shoulders in consequence of his evil deeds, appeared
to the human race like serpents, the pain caused by
which could only be alleviated by the application of
human brains. They also say that the celebrated
<dfn>Simúrgh</dfn><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_290" id="fnanchor_290"></a><a href="#footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></span>
(griffin) was a sage, who had retired from
the world and taken up his peaceful abode in the
<a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 56</span>
mountains: he was therefore called by this name,
and was the instructor of <span class="person">Dastan</span>, the son of Sám;
so that Zál, through his instruction, attained the
knowledge of the occult sciences. As to the current
tradition about Kai-Káus attempting to ascend to
Heaven, and his downfall, this occurred, according
to them, during his sleep, and not when he was
awake. Kai Nishín, his brother, who had retired
from all intercourse with mankind, thus interprets
the adventure of Káus: “The four eagles are the
four elements; the throne, the predominating
passions; the lance, their energy and impetuosity
in the desire of sensual gratifications; the thighs
of flesh, their various pursuits of anger, passion,
lust, and envy; their ascent implies that they may
be subdued by religious austerities, and by the aid
of their energy be made the means of ascending
to the world on high and the supreme Heaven;
their fall, instead of reaching Heaven’s eternal
mansions, intimates that if, even for a short period,
we become careless about repressing evil
propensities, and desist from the practice of mortification,
the passions will return back to their
nature, or wander from the eternal paradise, the
natural abode of souls:” the hemistich, “<em>during
one moment I was heedless, and he was removed
from me a journey of a hundred years</em>,” is applicable
to such a state.</p>

<p><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 57</span>
Rustam’s<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_291" id="fnanchor_291"></a><a href="#footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></span>
bringing back Kai Káus to his throne
from the forest into which he had fallen, means, his
bringing back intelligence into the king’s soul, and
turning him back from the desert (lit. meadow), of
natural infirmity: Kai Kaus therefore, by direction
of Kai Nishin, his younger brother, but his elder
in purity of faith and good works, remained forty
days in retirement, until in the state of sleep,
through the awakening of his heart, he beheld this
heavenly vision. They also assert, whatever modern
writers have declared, relative to
<span class="title">Khizr</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_292" id="fnanchor_292"></a><a href="#footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></span> and
Iskander, having penetrated into the regions of darkness,
where the former discovered the fountain of
life immortal, means, that the Iskander, or the intellectual
soul, through the energy of the Khizr, or
<a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 58</span>
reason, discovered, whilst in the state of human
darkness, the water of life, or the knowledge of the
rational sciences, or the science which forms the
proper object of intellect&mdash;as to what they say about
Iskander’s returning back empty-handed, by that is
meant, that to expect eternal duration in this evanescent
abode being altogether absurd, he consequently
could not attain that object, and therefore
departed to the next world. What they record
about Khizr’s drinking of that water, means, that
the perfection of intellect exists not through the
medium of body, and that reason has no need of
body, or any thing corporeal, either as essence or
attribute.</p>

<p>In some passages they interpret the tradition after
this manner; by Khizr is meant the intellectual
soul, or rational faculty, and by Iskander the animal
soul, or natural instinct; the Khizr of the intellectual
soul, associated with the Iskander of the animal
soul, and the host (of perceptions) arrived at the
fountain-head of understanding, and obtained immortality,
whilst the Iskander of the animal soul returned
back empty-handed.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_293" id="fnanchor_293"></a><a href="#footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></span>
It must be remarked,
<a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 59</span>
that this sect explain after this manner, whatever
transgresses the rules of probability, or cannot be
weighed in the balance of comprehension; in short,
all that is contrary to reason. They also say purification
is of two kinds; the <span class="title">amighi</span> or true, and the
<span class="title">ashkari</span> or apparent: the first consists in not defiling
the heart with any thing; in not attaching it
to the concerns of this treacherous world, emancipating
it from all ties and prejudice, maintaining
no connection with any object whatever, and washing
away all bias from the soul. The <dfn>Ashkari</dfn>, or
apparent, consists in removing to a distance whatever
appears unclean; consequently this purification
is effected with water which has undergone no
change of color, smell, or taste: that is, which is
free from bad color, smell, or taste; if otherwise,
rose-water and such like are more to be commended.
Ablution requires a <dfn>kur</dfn>, or a measure of lustral
water; that is, according to them, the measure for a
man, is that quantity into which he can immerge his
head; for an elephant, a quantity proportioned to
his bulk; and for a gnat, a single drop of water.
They reckon it meritorious to recite the prayers and
texts of the <span class="title">Shat Dasátír</span>, relative to the unity of the
<a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 60</span>
self-existent Creator, the great dignity of intelligence
and souls, with the pains of the superior and inferior
bodies; after which they repeat the benedictions
of the seven planets, particularly on their days, and
offer up the appropriate incense. The worshipper
after this recites the praises of the guardian of the
month, and those of the days of the month; for example,
if it be the month of
<span class="title">Farvardin</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_294" id="fnanchor_294"></a><a href="#footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></span>
the believer
repeats benedictions on that angel, and then on each
of the regents of the days of that month: particularly
the regent of that day called by the same name
as the month: which day is also regarded as a
festival.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_295" id="fnanchor_295"></a><a href="#footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></span>
For instance, in the month of <span class="title">Farvardin</span>, he
utters benedictions on the angel <span class="title">Farvardin</span>, who is
one of the cherubim on whom that month is dependent;
if it be the first day of the month, called the
<a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 61</span>
day of <dfn>Hormuz</dfn> (the angel who superintends the first
day of the month), the believers address their benedictions
to <span class="title">Hormuz</span>; and act in a similar manner on
the other months and their respective days. According
to them, the names of the months are called after
the names of their lords; and the appellations of the
days are according to the names of their respective
regents: consequently, as we have said, the believer
adores the lord of the month, and on festivals, pays
adoration to the angel who is the lord of the month
and the day.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_296" id="fnanchor_296"></a><a href="#footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></span>
According to the Abadian, although
<a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 62</span>
in a month, the name of the month and of the day
be the same, this coincidence makes not that day
dependant on the month, but on the regent who
bears the same name with him, consequently it is
necessary to celebrate a festival. In the same manner,
on the other days of every month, salutations
are paid every morning to the regent of the day: also
during the <dfn>Sudbar</dfn>, or the intercalary days, they
offer up praises to their angels. They also regard
the angels of the days as the ministers to the angels
of the months, all of whom are subject to the majesty
of the Great Light&mdash;in like manner the other
stars (planets) have also angels dependent on them:
they also believe that the angels dependent on each
<a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 63</span>
star (planet) are beyond all number: and finally, that
the angelic host belonging to the solar majesty are
reckoned the highest order. Besides, on the period
at which any of the seven planets passes from one
zodiacal mansion to another, they make an entertainment
on the first day, which they regard as a
festival, and call it <dfn>Shadbar</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_297" id="fnanchor_297"></a><a href="#footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></span>
or “replete with joy.”
Every month also, on the completion of the lunar
revolution, on ascertaining its reappearance from
astronomical calculation, they make great rejoicings
on the first day: there is in like manner a great
festival when any star has completed its revolution,
which day they call <dfn>Dádram</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_298" id="fnanchor_298"></a><a href="#footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></span>
or “banquet decking.”
Thus, although there is a festival every day
of the week in some idol-temple or other, as has
been before stated, relative to the day of <dfn>Nahid</dfn>, or
Friday, in the temple of this idol: yet on the day of
the Sun, or <dfn>Yakshambah</dfn> (the first day of the week),
there was a solemn festival at which all the people
assembled. In like manner they made a feast whenever
a star returned to its mansion or was in its
zenith.</p>

<p><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 64</span>
They believe it wrong to hold any faith or religious
system in abhorrence, as according to them,
we may draw near to God in every faith: also that
no faith has been abolished by divine authority&mdash;they
hold that, on this account, there have been so
many prophets, in order to shew the various ways
which lead to God. Those who carefully investigate
well know, that the ways which lead to heaven
are many; nay more than come within the compass
of numbers. It is well understood, that access to a
great sovereign is more easily attained through the
aid of his numerous ministers; although one of the
prince’s commanders be on bad terms with his confidential
advisers, or even should all the chiefs not
co-operate with each other; yet they can promote
the interest of their inferiors: therefore it is not
proper to say that we can get to the God of all existence
by one road only. But the insurmountable
barrier in the road of approaching God is the slaughter
of the Zindíbar, that is, those animals which
inflict no injury on any person, and slay not other
living creatures, such as the cow, the sheep, the
camel, and the horse: there is assuredly no salvation
to the author of cruelty towards such, nor can
he obtain final deliverance by austerities or devotions
of any description. Should we even behold
many miraculous works performed by the slayer of
harmless animals, we are not even then to regard
<a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 65</span>
him as one redeemed; the works witnessed in him
are only the reward of his devotions, and the result
of his perseverance in the practice of religious austerities
in this world: and as he commits evil, he
cannot be perfect in his devout exercises, so that
nothing but suffering can await him in another
generation (when born again): such an instance of
an ascetic endued with miraculous powers is likened
in the Shat Dasatir<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_299" id="fnanchor_299"></a><a href="#footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></span>
to a vase externally covered
with choice perfumes, but filled internally with impurities.
They also maintain that in no system of
faith is cruelty to innoxious animals sanctioned: and
all human sanction for such acts proceeds from their
attending to the apparent import of words, without
having recourse to profound or earnest consideration&mdash;for
example, by putting a horse or cow to
death is meant, the removal or banishing from one’s
<a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 66</span>
self animal propensities, and not the slaughtering
or devouring of innoxious creatures. They state
the later historians to have recorded without due
discrimination that Rustam, the son of Dastan (who
was one of the perfect saints), used to slay such animals:
whereas tradition informs us, that the mighty
champion pursued in the chase noxious animals
only: what they write about his hunting the wild
ass, implies that the elephant-bodied hero called the
lion a wild ass; or “that a lion is no more than a
wild ass when compared to my force.” In the
several passages where he is recorded to have slaughtered
harmless wild asses and oppressed innoxious
creatures, and where similar actions are ascribed to
some of the Gilsháíyán princes, there is only implied
the banishment of animal propensities and passions:
thus the illustrious Shaikh Farideddin ât´ár declares,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“In the heart of each are found a hundred swine;</div>
  <div class="i0">You must slay the hog or hind on the Zanar.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_300" id="fnanchor_300"></a><a href="#footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></span></div>
 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>They hold that, from the commencement to the
very end, the chiefs of the Persian Sipásíán, far from
slaughtering these harmless creatures, regarded as
an incumbent duty to avoid and shun, by every precaution,
the practice of oppression or destruction
towards them: nay, they inflicted punishment on
the perpetrators of such deeds. Although they esteem
<a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 67</span>
the Gilsháíyán prophets, pontiffs, and princes,
exceedingly holy personages, yet in their opinion,
they come not up in perfect wisdom and works to
the preceding apostles and sovereigns, who appeared
from the Yassánián to the end of the Máhábádíán
race.</p>

<p>They assert that some innoxious animals suffer
oppression in this generation by way of retribution:
for instance, an ox or a horse, which in times long
past had, through heedlessness, wantonness, or
without necessity, destroyed a man: as these creatures
understand nothing but how to eat and drink,
consequently when they obtain a new birth, they
carry burdens, which is by no means to be regarded
as an act of oppression, but as a retribution or retaliation
for their previous misconduct. They are not
put to death, as they are not naturally destructive
and sanguinary: their harmless nature proves that
they cannot be reckoned among the destroyers of
animal life: so that putting them to death is the same
as destroying an ignorant harmless man: therefore
their slayer, though he may not receive in this world
the merited punishment from the actual ruler or
governor, appears in the next generation under the
form of a ferocious beast, and meets his deserts. A
great man says on this subject:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“In every evil deed committed by thee, think not that it</div>
  <div class="i0">Is passed over in Heaven or neglected in the resolutions of time;</div>
<a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 68</span>
  <div class="i0">Thy evil deeds are a debt, ever in the presence of fortune,</div>
  <div class="i0">Which must be repaid, in whatever age she makes the demand.”</div>
 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>They also hold the eternal paradise to be the Heavens;
and regard the solar majesty as lord of the
empyrean; and the other stars, fixed or planetary,
as his ministers: thus a person who, through religious
mortifications and purity of life, attains righteousness
in words and deeds, is united with the sun
and becomes an empyreal sovereign: but if the proportion
of his good works bear a closer affinity to
any other star, he becomes lord of the place assigned
to that star: whilst others are joined to the firmament
on high: the perfect man passes on still farther,
arriving at the æthereal sphere, or the region
of pure spirits; such men attain the beatific vision of
the light of lights and the cherubinic hosts of the
Supreme Lord. Should he be a prince during
whose reign no harmless animals were slaughtered
in his realms; and who, if any were guilty of these
acts, inflicted punishment on the perpetrators of the
crimes, so that no such characters departed this
world without due retribution; he is esteemed a
wise, beneficent, and virtuous king: and immediately
on being separated from the elements of body,
he is united with the sun: his spirit is identified
with that of the majesty of the great light and he
becomes an æthereal sovereign. Prince Siamak,
the son of Kaiomors declares: “I beheld from first
<a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 69</span>
to last all the Abádíán, Jyáníán, Sháíyán, and
Yassáníán monarchs: some were cherubim in the
presence of the Supreme Lord; others absorbed
in the contemplation of the Light of Lights: but
I found none lower than the sphere of the sun,
the vicegerent of God.” On my asking them concerning
the means of attaining these high degrees,
they said: “The great means of acquiring this dignity
consist in the protection of harmless animals,
and inflicting punishment on evil doers.”</p>

<p>According to this sect, labouring under insanity,
suffering distress on account of one’s children, being
assailed by diseases, the visitations of providence,
these calamities are the retribution of actions in a
former state of existence. If a person should fall
down or stumble when running, even this is regarded
as the retribution of past deeds: as are also
the maladies of new-born babes. But whatever
happens to a just man, which is evidently unmerited,
this is not to be looked on as retribution, but as proceeding
from the oppression of the temporal ruler,
from whom, in a future generation, the Supreme
Ruler will demand an account.</p>

<p>According to their tenets, the drinking of wine or
strong liquors to excess, or partaking of things which
impair the understanding, is by no means to be tolerated:
which may be proved by this reflexion, that
the perfection of man is understanding, and that intoxicating
<a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 70</span>
beverages reduce human nature, whilst in
that state, to a level with the brute creation. If a
person drink strong liquors to excess, he is brought
before the judge to receive due castigation; and
should he, during that state, do injury to another,
he is held accountable for it, and is punished also
as a malefactor.</p>

<p>Among this sect it is permitted to kill those animals
which oppress others, such as lions, fowls,
and hawks, which prey on living creatures: but
whatever animals, whether noxious or innoxious,
suffer violence from the noxious, duly receive it by
way of retribution: when they slay the former, or
noxious animals, that is regarded as a retribution,
because in a former existence they were oppressive
and sanguinary creatures: and in this generation the
Almighty has given them over to other more sanguinary
animals, that they might shed the blood of
the sanguinary bloodshedder: so that when noxious
creatures are slain, it is by way of retribution for
having shed blood: the very act of shedding their
blood proves them to have been formerly shedders
of blood: it is not however allowed to put them to
death until they become hurtful: for example, a
young sparrow cannot, whilst in that state, commit
an injury; but, when able to fly, it injures the insects
of the earth; and, although this happens to the insects
by way of retributive justice, yet their slayers
<a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 71</span>
become also deserving of being slain, as in a former
generation they have been shedders of blood. For
instance, a person has unwittingly slain another, for
which crime he has been thrown into prison; on
which they summons one of the other prisoners to
behead the murderer: after which the judge commands
one of his officers to put the executioner
to death, as, previous to this act, he had before
shed blood unjustly. But if a man slay a noxious
animal, he is not to be put to death, because that
person taking into consideration the noxious animal’s
oppression, has inflicted retribution on it:
but if a brave champion or any other be slain in
fighting with a noxious creature; this was his merited
retribution; and it is the same if an innoxious
animal be slain in fighting with a noxious creature:
for example, in a past generation the ox was
a man endued with many brutal propensities, who
with violence and insolence forced people into his
service and imposed heavy burdens on them, until
he deprived some of them of life: therefore in this
generation, on account of his ruling propensities, he
comes in the form of an ox, that he may receive the
retribution due to his former deeds, and in return
for his having shed blood, should be himself slain
by a lion or some such creature. But mankind are
not permitted to kill the harmless animals, and these
are not shedders of blood: and if such an act should
<a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 72</span>
be inadvertently perpetrated by any individuals, destructive
animals are then appointed to retaliate on
them, as we have explained under the head of the ox.</p>

<p>The best mode to be adopted by merciful men
for putting to death destructive creatures, such as
fowls, sparrows, and the like, is the following: let
them open a vein, so that it may die from the effusion
of blood: there are many precepts of this kind recorded
in the <span class="title">Jashen Sudah</span> of the <span class="title">Móbed Hoshyár</span>:
but philosophers, eminent doctors, and durveshes
who abandon the world, never commit such acts:
it is however indispensably necessary that a king, in
the course of government, should inflict on the evildoer
the retaliation due to his conduct. The Móbed
<span class="title">Hoshyár</span> relates, in the
<span class="title">Sarud-i-Mastán</span>, that in
the time of Kaíomors and Siamak, no animal of
any kind was slain, as they were all obedient to the
commands of these princes. So that one of the <dfn>Farjúd</dfn>,
or miraculous powers possessed by the Yezdanian
chiefs of Iran, from Kaíomors to Jemshíd, was
their appointing a certain class of officers to watch
over the animal creation, so that they should not
attack each other. For instance, a lion was not
permitted to destroy any animal, and if he killed one
in the chase, he met with due punishment; consequently
no creature was slain or destroyed, and carnage
fell into such disuse among noxious animals,
that they were all reckoned among the innoxious.
<a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 73</span>
However, the skins of animals which had died a
natural death were taken off, and in the beginning
used as clothing by Kaíomors and his subjects: but
they were latterly satisfied with the leaves of trees.
Those who embrace the tenets of this holy race attribute
this result to the miraculous powers of these
monarchs, and some profound thinkers regard it as
effected by a <dfn>talisman</dfn>; whilst many skilled in interpretation
hold it to be an enigmatical mode of expression:
thus, the animal creation submitting to government
implies, the justice of the sovereigns; their vigilance
in extirpating corruption and evil, and producing
good. In short, when in the course of succession
the Gilsháíyán crown came to Húshang, he enjoined
the people to eat the superabundant eggs of ducks,
domestic fowls, and such like, but not to such a
degree that, through their partaking of such food,
the race of these creatures should become extinct.
When the throne of sovereignty was adorned by the
presence of Tahmúras, he said, “It is lawful for
carnivorous and noxious creatures to eat dead
bodies:” that is, if a lion find a lifeless stag, or a
sparrow a dead worm, they may partake of them.
In the same manner, when Jemshid assumed the
crown, he enacted: “If men of low caste eat the flesh
of animals which die a natural death, they commit
no sin.” The reason why people do not at
present eat of animals which died in the course of
<a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 74</span>
nature, is, that their flesh engenders disease, as the
animal died of some distemper: otherwise there is
no sin attached to the eating of it. When Jemshid
departed to the mansions of eternity, <span class="person">Deh
Ak</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_301" id="fnanchor_301"></a><a href="#footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></span> the
Arab, slew and partook of all animals indifferently,
whether destructive or harmless, so that the detestable
practice became general. When Faridún had
purged the earth from the pollution of Zohák’s
tyranny, he saw that some creatures, hawks, lions,
wolves, and others of the destructive kind, gave
themselves up to the chase in violation of the original
covenant: he therefore enjoined the slaughter
of these classes. After this, Jraj permitted men of
low caste, that is the mass of the people, to partake
of destructive creatures, such as domestic fowls
(which prey upon worms), also sparrows and such
like, in killing which no sin is incurred: but the
holy Yezdanians never polluted their mouths with
flesh, or killed savage animals for themselves, although
they slew them for others of the same class.
For example, the hawk, lion, and other rapacious
animals of prey were kept in the houses of the great,
for the purpose of inflicting punishment on other
destructive animals, and not that men should partake
of them: for eating flesh is not an innate quality in
men, as whenever they slay animals for food, ferocity
settles in their nature, and that aliment introduces
<a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 75</span>
habits of rapacity: whereas the true meaning of putting
destructive animals to death, is the extirpation
of wickedness. The Yezdanians also have certain
viands, which people at present confound with animals
and flesh: for instance, they give the name of
<dfn>barah</dfn>, “lamb,” to a dish composed of the <dfn>zingú</dfn>, or
egg-mushroom; <dfn>gaur</dfn>, or “onager” is a dish made
out of cheese: with many others of the same kind.
Although they kill destructive animals in the chase,
they never eat of them; and if in their houses they
kill one destructive animal for the food of another,
such as a sparrow for a hawk, it is done by a man
styled <dfn>Dazhkím</dfn>, or executioner, who is lower than a
<dfn>Milar</dfn>, called in <span class="title">Hindi</span>, <dfn>Juharah</dfn> or “sweeper,” and
in modern language <dfn>Hallál Khúr</dfn>, or one to whom
all food is lawful. But the dynasty preceding Gilshah,
from whom the Yezdanians derive their tenets,
afforded no protection whatever to destructive animals,
as they esteemed the protection of the oppressor
most reprehensible. In the time of the Gilsháíyán
princes, they nourished hawks and such like, for the
purpose of retaliating on destructive animals; for
example, they let loose the hawk on the sparrow,
which is the emblem of <span class="title">Ahriman</span>; and when the
hawk grew old, they cut off his head and killed him
for his former evil deeds. The first race never kept
any destructive creatures, as they esteemed it criminal
to afford them protection; and even their destruction
<a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 76</span>
never took place in the abodes of righteous
and holy persons.</p>

<p>Among the Sipasíyan sect were many exemplary
and pious personages, the performers of praiseworthy
discipline: with them, however, voluntary
austerity implies “religious practices” or <dfn>Saluk</dfn>,
and consists not in extreme suffering, which they
hold to be an evil, and a retribution inflicted for
previous wicked deeds. According to this sect,
the modes of walking in the paths of God are manifold:
such as seeking God; the society of the
wise; retirement and seclusion from the world;
purity of conduct; universal kindness; benevolence;
reliance on God; patience; endurance; contentedness;
resignation; and many such like qualities&mdash;as
thus recorded in the <span class="title">Sarúd-i-Mustán</span> of
the <span class="title">Móbed Hushyar</span>. The <span class="title">Móbed Khodá Jáí</span>, in the
“Cup of <span class="title">Kái Khusró</span>,” a commentary on the text
of the poem of the venerable <span class="person">Azar Kaivan</span>, thus relates:
“He who devotes himself to walking in the
path of God, must be well-skilled in the medical
sciences, so that he may rectify whatever predominates
or exceeds in the bodily humours: in the
next place, he must banish from his mind all
articles of faith, systems, opinions, ceremonials,
and be at peace with all: he is to seat himself in
a small and dark cell, and gradually diminish the
quantity of his food.” The rules for the diminution
<a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 77</span>
of food are thus laid down in the <span class="title">Sharistan</span>
of the holy doctor <span class="person">Ferzanah Bahram</span>, the son of
<span class="person">Farhád</span>: “From his usual food, the pious recluse
is every day to subtract three direms, until he
reduces it to ten direms weight: he is to sit in
perfect solitude, and give himself up to meditation.”
Many of this sect have brought themselves
to one direm weight of food: their principal devotional
practice turning on these five points: namely,
fasting, silence, waking, solitude, and meditation on
God. Their modes of invoking God are manifold,
but the one most generally adopted by them is that
of the <span class="title">Múk Zhúp</span>: now in the <dfn>Azanan</dfn> or <dfn>Pehlevi</dfn>,
<dfn>Múk</dfn> signifies “four,” and <dfn>Zhúp</dfn> “a blow;” this
state of meditation is also called <dfn>Char Sang</dfn>, “the
four weights,” and <dfn>Char Kúb</dfn>, “the four blows.”
The next in importance is the <dfn>siyá zhúp</dfn>, “the three
weights” or “three blows.” The sitting postures
among these devotees are numerous; but the more
approved and choice are limited to eighty-four; out
of these they have selected fourteen; from the fourteen
they have taken five; and out of the five two are
chosen by way of eminence: with respect to these
positions, many have been described by the <span class="title">Móbud
Sarúsh</span> in the <span class="title">Zerdúsht Afshár</span>: of these two, the
choice position is the following: The devotee sits
on his hams, cross-legged, passing the outside of
the right foot over the left thigh, and that of the left
<a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 78</span>
foot over the right thigh; he then passes his hands
behind his back, and holds in his left hand the great
toe of the right foot, and in the right hand the great
toe of the left foot, fixing his eyes intently on the
point of the nose: this position they call <dfn>Farnishin</dfn>,
“the splendid seat,” but by the Hindi Jogies it is
named the <dfn>Padma ásan</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_302" id="fnanchor_302"></a><a href="#footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></span>
or “Lotus seat.” If he
then repeat the <span class="title">Zekr-i-Mukzhub</span>, he either lays hold
of the great toes with his hands, or if he prefer,
removes his feet off the thighs, seating himself in the
ordinary position, which is quite sufficient&mdash;then,
with closed eyes, the hands placed on the thighs,
the armpits open, the back erect, the head thrown
forward, and fetching up from the navel with all
his force the word <dfn>Nist</dfn>, he raises his head up: next,
in reciting the word <dfn>Hésti</dfn>, he inclines the head
towards the right breast; on reciting the word <dfn>Magar</dfn>,
he holds the head erect; after which he utters
<dfn>Yezdan</dfn>, bowing the head to the left breast, the seat
of the heart. The devotee makes no pause between
the words thus recited; nay, if possible, he utters
several formularies in one breath, gradually increasing
their number. The words of the formulary
(<dfn>Nist hesti magar yezdan</dfn>, “there is no existence
save God”) are thus set forth: “Nothing exists
but God;” or, “There is no God, but God;” or,
<a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 79</span>
“There is no adoration except for what is adorable;”
or this, “He to whom worship is due is pure and
necessarily existent;” or, “He who is without
equal, form, color, or model.” It is permitted
to use this formulary publicly, but the inward meditation
is most generally adopted by priests and holy
persons; as the senses become disturbed by exclamations
and clamors, and the object of retirement is
to keep them collected. In the inward meditation,
the worshipper regards three objects as present:
“God, the heart, and the spirit of his Teacher;”
whilst he revolves in his heart the purport of this
formulary: “There is nothing in existence but
God.” But if he proceeds to the suppression of
breath, which is called the “knowledge of <dfn>Dam</dfn>
and <dfn>Súmrad</dfn>,” or the science of breath and imagination,
he closes not the eyes, but directs them
to the tip of the nose, as we have before explained
under the first mode of sitting: this institute has
also been recorded in the <span class="title">Surud-i-Mastan</span>, but the
present does not include all the minute
details.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_303" id="fnanchor_303"></a><a href="#footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 80</span>
It is thus recorded in the <span class="title">Zerdúsht Afshár</span>; the
worshipper having closed the right nostril, enumerates
the names of God from once to sixteen times,
and whilst counting draws his breath upwards;
after which he repeats it twenty-two times, and lets
the breath escape out of the right nostril, and whilst
counting propels the breath aloft; thus passing from
the six Kháns or stages to the seventh; until from
the intensity of imagination he arrives to a state in
which he thinks that his soul and breath bound like
the jet of a fountain to the crown of the head: they
enumerate the seven stages, or the seven degrees, in
this order: 1st, the position of sitting; 2d, the
hips; 3d, the navel; 4th, the pine-heart; 5th, the
windpipe; 6th, the space between the eyebrows;
and 7th, the crown of the head. As causing the
breath to mount to the crown of the head is a power
peculiar to the most eminent persons; so, whoever
can convey his breath and soul together to that part,
becomes the viceregent of God. According to another
institute, the worshipper withdraws from all
senseless pursuits, sits down in retirement, giving
up his heart to his original world on high, and without
moving the tongue, repeats in his heart Yezdan!
Yezdan! or God! God! which address to the
Lord may be made in any language, as Hindi, Arabic,
etc. Another rule is, the idea of the Instructor:
the worshipper imagines him to be present and is
<a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 81</span>
never separated from that thought, until he attains
to such a degree, that the image of his spiritual
guide is never absent from the mind’s eye, and he
then turns to contemplate his heart: or he has a
mirror before his sight, and beholds his own form,
until, from long practice, it is never more separated
from the heart, to which he then directs himself:
or he sits down to contemplate his heart, and reflects
on it as being in continual movement. In all
these cases he regards the practices of the suppression
of the breath as profitable for the abstraction
of thought: an object which may also be effected
without having recourse to it.</p>

<p>Another rule is, what they call <dfn>ázád áwá</dfn>, or the
“free voice;” in Hindi <dfn>Ánahid</dfn>; and in Arabic
<dfn>Sáut Mutluk</dfn>, or “the absolute sound.” Some of
the followers of Mohammed relate, that it is recorded
in the traditions, that a revelation came to
the venerable prophet of Arabia resembling “the

<div class="poem-container">

<p class="unindent">The mode of hearing it is after this manner: the
devotees direct the hearing and understanding to
the brain, and whether in the gloom of night, in the
house, or in the desert, hear this voice, which they
<a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 82</span>
esteem as their <dfn>Zikker</dfn>, or “address to God.”
Azizi<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_304" id="fnanchor_304"></a><a href="#footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></span>
thus expresses himself:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“I recognise that playful sportiveness,</div>
  <div class="i0">And well know that amount of blandishment:</div>

<p>Then having opened the eyes and looking between
the eyebrows, a form appears. Some of those
who walk in the path of religious poverty among
the followers of Mohammed (on whom be benedictions!)
assert that the expression <dfn>Kab Kausain</dfn>, “I
was near two bows’ length,” alludes to this vision.
Finally, if they prefer it, having closed the eyes for
some time, they reflect on the form which appeared
to them on looking between the eyebrows; after
which they meditate on the heart; or without
contemplating the form, they commence by looking
into the heart; and closing both eyes and ears,
give themselves up entirely to meditation on the
heart, abandoning the external for the internal:
<a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 83</span>
whoever can thus contemplate obtains all that he
wants; but</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">

 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>Finally the searcher after the Being who is without
equal or form, without color or pattern, whom
they know and comprehend in the Parsi under the
name of “<span class="title">Izad</span>,” in Arabic by the blessed name of
“<span class="title">Allah</span>,” and in Hindi as “<span class="title">Para Brahma Náráyaran
a</span>,”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_305" id="fnanchor_305"></a><a href="#footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></span>
contemplates him without the intervention of Arabic,
Persian, Hindi, or any other language, keeping
the heart in his presence, until he, being rescued
from the shadows of doubt, is identified with God.
The venerable <span class="person">Maulaví Jami</span> says on this head:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“Thou art but an atom, He, the great whole; but if for a few days</div>

<p>They hold that reunion with the first principle,
which the Sufees interpret by evanescence and
permanence, means not, according to the distinguished
Ishrakian<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_306" id="fnanchor_306"></a><a href="#footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></span>
or Platonists of Persia, that
the beings of accident or creation are blended with
him whose existence is necessary, or that created
beings cease to exist; but that when the sun of the
first cause manifests himself, then apparently all
created beings, like the stars in the sun’s light, are
<a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 84</span>
absorbed in his divine effulgence; and if the searcher
after God should continue in this state, he will comprehend
how they become shrouded through the
sun’s overpowering splendor, or like the ecstatic
Sufees he will regard them as annihilated: but the
number of Sufís who attain to this state is exceedingly
small, and the individuals themselves are but
little known to fame. This volume would not be
sufficient to enumerate the amount of those lights
(precepts) which direct the pilgrim on his course,
but the venerable <span class="person">Azur Kaiván</span> has treated at large
on this head in the <span class="title">Jám-i-Kai Khusró</span>.</p>

<p>It is, however, necessary to mention that there
are four states of vision; the first,
<dfn>Núníar</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_307" id="fnanchor_307"></a><a href="#footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></span>
or that
which is seen during sleep: by sleep is meant that
state when the subtile fumes arising from the food
taken into the stomach mounting up to the brain,
overpower external perceptions at the time of repose:
whatever is then beheld is called in Farsi
<dfn>Tínáb</dfn>, in Arabic <dfn>Rúyá</dfn>, and in Hindi
<dfn>Svapna</dfn>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_308" id="fnanchor_308"></a><a href="#footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></span> The
state beyond this dignity is
<dfn>Susvapna</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_309" id="fnanchor_309"></a><a href="#footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></span> in Arabic
<dfn>Ghaib</dfn> or “mysterious,” and in the popular language
<a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 85</span>
of the Hindoos <dfn>Sukhásváda</dfn><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_310" id="fnanchor_310"></a><a href="#footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></span>
or <dfn>Samádhi</dfn><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_311" id="fnanchor_311"></a><a href="#footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></span> (suspending
the connexion between soul and body),
which is as follows: when divine grace is communicated
from the worlds on high, and the transport
arising from that grace locks up external perceptions,
whatever is beheld during that state is called
<dfn>Binab</dfn> or “revelation:” but that state into which
the senses enter, or <dfn>Hóshwázhen</dfn>, “a trance,” which
is expressed in Arabic by <dfn>Sahú</dfn> or “recovering
from ebriety,” and in Hindi by
<dfn>Jagrat</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_312" id="fnanchor_312"></a><a href="#footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></span> “awaking,”
and <dfn>Pratyaya</dfn> “evidence,”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_313" id="fnanchor_313"></a><a href="#footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></span>
means that state in which
divine grace being communicated, without the senses
being overpowered, it transports the person for the
time being to the world of reality: whatever he beholds
in this state is called <dfn>Bínáb</dfn> or <dfn>Mâainah</dfn> “reality.”
The state higher than this is the power of
the soul to quit the body and to return to it, which
is called in Farsi <dfn>Nívah-i-chaminah</dfn>, in Arabic <dfn>Melkát
Khalâ-baden</dfn>, and in Hindu <dfn>prapura
paroksha</dfn>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_314" id="fnanchor_314"></a><a href="#footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>They affirm that the bodies occupied by some
souls resemble a loose garment, which may be put
off at pleasure; so that they can ascend to the world
<a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 86</span>
of light, and on their return become reunited
with the material elements. The difference between
<dfn>Sahú</dfn> and <dfn>Khalâ</dfn> is this: <dfn>Sahú</dfn> means, being
absorbed in meditation on the communication of
divine grace, so that, without a relaxation of the
senses, the person may, for the time being, actually
abide in the invisible world: whereas <dfn>Khalâ</dfn> means,
that the individual, whenever he pleases, separates
himself from the body and returns to it when he
thinks fitting. The spiritual Maulavi thus says:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“Shout aloud, my friends! for one person has separated himself from the body;</div>
  <div class="i0">Out of a hundred thousand bodies, one person has become identified with God.”</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>According to this sect there are seven worlds:
the first is absolute existence and pure being, which
they call <dfn>Arang</dfn><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_315" id="fnanchor_315"></a><a href="#footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></span>
or “divinity;” the second is the
world of intelligences, which they call <dfn>Birang</dfn> or
“the empyreal;” the third is that of souls, called
<dfn>Alrang</dfn> or the angelic; the fourth that of the superior
bodies, or <dfn>Nirang</dfn>; the fifth, the elementary or
<dfn>Rang</dfn>; the sixth the compounds of the four elements,
or <dfn>Rang-a-Rang</dfn>: but according to the Sufís
all bodies, whether superior or inferior, are named
<dfn>Málk</dfn> or region; the seventh is <dfn>Sarang</dfn>, which
<a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 87</span>
is that of man or of human beings: but in some
Parsi treatises they term these seven regions the
seven true realities: however, if the author were to
describe minutely the articles and ceremonies of this
sect, their details would require so many volumes,
that contenting himself with what has been stated,
he now proceeds to describe some of their most
distinguished followers of later times.</p>

Serósh is the name of an angel who presides over the 17th day of the
month; according to their religion, he is moreover the most active of
the celestial spirits; as king of the earth, he passes every day and every
night three times through his empire; his throne is the summit of the
world; all light, all intelligence, he purifies and fertilizes the earth,
blesses and protects mankind, strikes the evil spirits; in short, he is adored
equal to the supreme being. (See <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Zend Avesta, par Anquetil du Perron</cite>,

 The text given by Gladwin (<cite>see the New Asiatic Miscellany, <abbr title="volume one page">vol. I.
p.</abbr> 93</cite>), and the manuscript of Oude, have no negative before خجسته;
the sense would therefore be: “if his words had been plausible, but the
deeds bad.” The <abbr title="edition">edit.</abbr> of Calcutta gives the sense
as above.&mdash;<abbr title="Anthony Troyer">A. T.</abbr></p>

 Gladwin translates this passage as follows (<cite>ibid., <abbr title="page">p.</abbr></cite> 94): “If a deserving
soul produces good words and deeds,” which is in accordance with
the text he followed, and with that of the <abbr title="edition">edit.</abbr> of Calcutta; but Shea’s

 The names <span class="title">Huristar</span>, <span class="title">Nuristar</span>, <span class="title">Suristar</span>, and <span class="title">Ruzistar</span>, of the four
classes of the people, are to be found in the Desatir (<abbr title="article">artic.</abbr> 145,
English translation, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 27), from which work the author of the Dabistan
is likely to have taken them, as various other information. As
this division of a nation is undoubtedly suggested by the natural state
of things, it has been attributed to more than one ancient king, and
by Ferdúsi, in his Shah-namah, to Jemshid, under four denominations
belonging to the ancient Persian language. These are as follows:
1ᵒ <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">اموزيان</span>, <span class="title">Amuzian</span>; 2ᵒ <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">نيساريان</span>,
<span class="title">Nisarian</span>; 3ᵒ <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">نسودی</span>,
<span class="title">Nasudi</span>; 4ᵒ <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">اهنو خوشی</span>, <span class="title">Ahnu khushi</span>, corresponding to the learned,
the warriors, the husbandmen, and the mechanics. The first of
these names, <span class="title">Amuzian</span>, is easily recognised in the Persian <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">اموختن</span>,
<dfn>amokhten</dfn> (Imp. <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">اموز</span> <dfn>amuz</dfn>), “to teach, to learn;” the second <dfn>nisarian</dfn>
is the same with <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">نيساری</span>, <dfn>nisari</dfn>, the common Persian word for a warrior;
the third, <dfn>nasudi</dfn>, is a Pehlevi noun (see Hyde, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 437); the fourth,
<span class="title">Ahnu´khu´shí</span>, appears composed of <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">اهنو</span>, <dfn>ahnu</dfn>, “provisions, meat” (to
be traced to <span lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">आह्निक</span>, <dfn>ahnika</dfn>, “daily work, food”), and of <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">خوشی</span>,
<dfn>khushi</dfn>, “good, content,” or from <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">خواستن</span> <dfn>khástan</dfn>, “to ask.” Upon

son of Baber, emperor of India (see the History of Ferishta, translated by
general John Briggs, <abbr title="volume Two, page">vol. II, p.</abbr> 71)
“caused seven halls of audience to be
built, in which he received persons according to their rank. The first,
called the palace of the Moon, was set apart for ambassadors, messengers
and travellers. In the second, called the palace of <span class="title">Utarid</span> (Venus),
civil officers, and persons of that description, were received; and there
were five other palaces for the remaining five planets. In each of these
buildings he gave public audience, according to the planet of the day.
The furniture and paintings of each, as also the dresses of the household
attendants, bore some symbol emblematical of the planet. In
each of these palaces he transacted business one day in the week.”&mdash;<abbr title="Anthony Troyer">A. T.</abbr></p>

bestow a particular veneration upon a black stone, which is attached

 The Safavean dynasty began in 1499 A. D. by Shah-Ismail, who
derives his origin from Musa, already mentioned as the seventh imam of
the Muselmans. All his ancestors were considered as pious men and
some as saints. The first of this family who gained a great reputation
was Shaik Sufi Ud-din, from whom this dynasty takes the name of Sufaviah.
His son was Sudder Ud-din. The monarchs of that time used to
visit his cell. Timur asked him what favour he could bestow on him.
The saint answered: “Set free all the prisoners whom thou hast brought
from Turkey.” The conqueror granted this request, and the grateful
tribes declared themselves the disciples of the man to whom they owed
their liberty. Their children preserved the sacred obligation of their
ancestors, and placed the son of the pious Eremite upon the throne of
Persia. (<cite>Malcolm’s <abbr title="History">Hist.</abbr> of Persia.</cite>)&mdash;<abbr title="Anthony Troyer">A. T.</abbr></p>

or general of the ancient monarch, named <span class="title">Zu-al-Kurnain</span>, or “the Two-horned;”
a title which was also assumed by Alexander the Great. According
to the Tárikh Muntakhab, this prophet was Abraham’s nephew, and
served as guide to Moses and the children of Israel, in their passage of the
Red sea and the desert. The same author tells us, that Khizr lived in
the time of Kai Kobad, at which time he discovered the fountain of life.

 Ferdusi in his Shah-namah narrates that: Secander was in search of
the water of life, accompanied by Khizr. The prophet attained his purpose,
but the king lost his way in the dark. The troops of the latter
followed a mare running after her foal, until they found themselves in a
place full of pebbles sounding beneath their feet, and heard a voice
from heaven, saying: “Take, or leave, the stones; sorrow of the heart
“awaits you in any case.” And so it happened. At day-break, the
stones picked up were found to be precious rubies; all were grieved: the
one for not having taken more, the others for not having taken any, of
them.&mdash;<abbr title="Anthony Troyer">A. T.</abbr></p>

 Farvardin presides over the 19th day of the month, and over the first
month of the year (Zend-Avesta, by Anquetil du Perron, <abbr title="Two, pages">II, p.</abbr> 320-337).
Hyde (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 239) says: the first month, March, in the Jeláli-year (or the new
Persian era of Jelaluddin) which first month was July in the old year, is
called <span class="title">Farvardin</span>, and he endeavours to derive this word from the modern
Persian. Anquetil du Perron (<abbr title="One, First">I, 1<sup>re</sup></abbr>
part. <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 493) rejects Hyde’s
etymology, and says that Farvardin signifies in Zend “the Fervers (the
souls) of the law.” Hyde himself seems to enter into this sense, in saying
(<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 240): <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Iste Angelus
(Farvardin) creditur præesse Animabus quæ in
Paradiso”</span> (this angel is believed to preside over the souls who are in
Paradise).&mdash;<abbr title="Anthony Troyer">A. T.</abbr></p>

 The most ancient year of the Persians (Hyde, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 188, 189) appears to
have been vague or erratic, its commencement varying through all the
different seasons, or at least soon gave room to the vague Persian-Median
civil year, to which was joined afterwards the fixed ecclesiastic
year of Jemshed. Both these years lasted to the time of Yezdejerd,
who made some considerable changes in the Persian calendar. This
king being killed, after an interval of time, the fixed solar year, beginning
in the middle of “pisces,” was introduced into Persia. The names of
the ancient months and days appear to have come from the Medes, with
their denomination, to the Persians; and even those invented by Yezdejerd
were of Median origin. Here follows the order of months called <span class="time">Jelali</span>

the Desátír itself: “There are two books of Yezdán. The name of the
first is <dfn>Dógítí</dfn>, ‘two worlds,’ and this they call the ‘Great Book,’
or in the language of Heaven <dfn>Ferz-Desatir</dfn>, or the ‘Great Desátir,’
which is the great volume of Yezdán. And the other book is called
Desátir, the doctrines of which Máhábád, and the other prophets from
Màhábád down to me, have revealed. * * * * And in the heavenly
tongue this is called <dfn>Derick Desatir</dfn>, ‘the Little Desátir,’ as being the

 These practices are evidently the same as those used among the Hindu
devotees. The chapter upon the Hindus, which follows, will set forth the
great conformity, nay, identity of Indian religions with the tenets and
customs here ascribed to Persian sects. In the Desátir (English <abbr title="translation Commentary">transl.

standing, or lying, or sitting, on the ground before any thing that burns,

of <span class="person">Abád Azád</span>, of the lineage of <span class="person">Mah Abád</span>, who
appeared with splendor in the beginning of the
great cycle. The mother of <span class="person">Kaiván</span> was named
<span class="title">Shirín</span>, a fortunate and illustrious dame descended
from the lineage of the just monarch Nushirvan.
Through eternal aid and almighty grace <span class="person">Azar Kaiván</span>,
from his fifth year, devoted himself to great
abstinence in food, and watching by night. <span class="person">Salím</span>
thus expresses himself:</p>

<div class="poem-container">

  <div class="i0b">“Innate essence has no need of instruction;</div>
  <div class="i0">How could an artist produce the image in the mirror?”</div>
 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>In the progress of his admirable voluntary mortification,
the quantity of his daily food was reduced
to one direm weight. On this point, the divine sage
Sunái observes:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“If thou eat to excess, thou becomest an unwieldy elephant;</div>
  <div class="i0">But if with moderation, thou becomest another Gabriel;</div>

<p><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 89</span>
He abode in Khum during twenty-eight years,
but removed in his latter days from the land of Iran
into India: he remained some time in Patna, where,
in the year of the Hegira 1027 (A. D. 1673), he
took his flight from this lower elementary abode to
the sphere of the mansions on high. Azízí observes:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“Whoever is wise, esteems this mortal coil the obstacle to union with God:</div>
  <div class="i0">This life is the death of Durvishes: look on (the world of) reality as a friend.”</div>
 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>He continued eighty-five years united to the elements
of body, during which time he never desisted
from the practice of austerities. On this subject
Hafiz of Shiraz observes:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“O! my heart, if thou once become acquainted with the lustre of austerity,</div>
  <div class="i0">Like those who strike the smiling taper, thou canst give up thy head&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">But thou longest after thy beloved and sparkling wine-bowl:</div>
  <div class="i0">Abstain from such desire, for thou canst accomplish better things.”</div>
 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p><span class="person">Farzánah Bahrám</span> relates in the <span class="title">Sharistan</span>, that
from the very commencement of his religious career,
Azar Kaiván, having resolved on learning thoroughly
the science and systems of the eminent sages of antiquity,
on this, the distinguished philosophers of
Hindustan, Greece, and Persia, having appeared to
him in a vision, communicated all kinds of knowledge.
He went one day to a college, where he
answered every question that was proposed, and
<a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 90</span>
gave the solution of every difficulty: he was therefore
entitled <span class="title">Zu-l-ulum</span>, or “the Master of Sciences.”
Ali Sani Amir Saiyid Ali of Hamadan observes:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“If thou advance even one step from this abode of vain desire,</div>
  <div class="i0">Thou mayest repose in the sanctuary of omnipotence;</div>
  <div class="i0">And if thou perform ablution with the water of religious austerity,</div>
  <div class="i0">Thou canst convert all the uncleanness of thy heart into purity;</div>
  <div class="i0">This path however is only traversed by the active pilgrim,</div>
  <div class="i0">How canst thou, the world’s idol, perform such a task?”</div>
 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>It is reported that Saiyid Hasan of Shiraz, who
was styled “the sage, the embellishment of pure
faith and works,” one day said thus: “On a certain day,
two followers of the Sufís came into
the presence of Azar Kaiván, and pursuing the
path of opposition to the Master of Sciences,
treated him not as one possessed of perfection.
Their teacher, a man equally eminent in theoretical
and practical science, who by dominion over
the external world had established the relation
of spiritual intercourse with the holy prophet, fell
one night into a state of ecstasy, and beheld in his
trance the effulgent perfection of the prophet,
who said to him: ‘My son! tell thy disciples
that through the assistance of the Only Wise
and the Omnipotent, who is independent of all,
Ali Kaiván is a completely perfect man, who has
attained to the different degrees of spiritual dominion,
by the practice of the seven cordial
ejaculations, and varied mysterious illuminations,
<a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 91</span>
visions, revelations, spiritual realities in his
acts and attributes: moreover his evanescent
existence, through grace predestined from eternity,
has received the boon of divine nature;
equally versed in special and general providence;
unique in the true knowledge of things from
inspection, not contented with the illumination
of tradition; the most perfect master of the
seekers after truth in matters of worship, seclusion,
social intercourse, and whatever is meet
and suitable to their state in all kinds of institutes
and religious austerities. He is the true
philosopher; the physician of the human race;
the discipline of religion; the institute of the
devout; the interpreter of events; the instructor
of worship; the director of those who seek God,
labouring diligently in the purification of souls;
co-operating in the cleansing of hearts; the spiritual
champion of the law; fighting the good
fight of faith; the principle of truth; confirmed
in the knowledge, source, and evidence of certainty;
supported by divine aid in the fundamental
points and collateral inductions. Let
not thy disciples calumniate him, but esteem
him a holy personage, and regard attendance on
him as pregnant with happiness: do thou also
approach his presence, and use every effort to
conciliate his affection.’ The teacher having
<a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 92</span>
during his ecstacy repeated this panegyric several
times, I committed the words to writing, and
on the holy man’s arising from his ecstatic trance,
he summoned me and said: ‘Who in this city
is Azar Kaiván? The prophet hath praised him
exceedingly, and ordered me to go into his presence.’
I answered: ‘He has lately come hither
from the direction of Istakhar:’ on which
he replied: ‘Conduct me near him.’ I therefore
accompanied him, but was ignorant of Kaiván’s
residence. When we had proceeded some time,
one of Kaiván’s disciples, by name Farhad, came
near him and said: ‘The master (that is Kaiván)
invites you, and has sent me to be your guide.’
When we came into his presence, my teacher had
determined in his mind to salute him first, but
was unable to obtain the priority, as Azar Kaiván
had much sooner anticipated him in salutations
in the Persian language, and afterwards addressed
him in Arabic. We were struck with astonishment.
My teacher then repeated what he had
communicated to me concerning the vision, on
which Kaiván commanded him ‘not to remove
the veil of this mystery.’” The teacher, on his
return, having called before him his two misguided
disciples, recounted the perfections of Kaiván, and
enjoined them to abstain from censuring the holy
man. For as Sadi says:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 93</span>

  <div class="i0b">“Respecting the thicket, imagine it not unoccupied,</div>
  <div class="i0">A tiger may probably be couched there.”</div>
 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>Azar Kaiván mixed little with the people of the
world; he shunned with horror all public admirers;
and seldom gave audience to any but his disciples
and the searchers after truth; never exposing himself
to the public gaze. According to Shaikh Baha
Uddin Muhammad of Amil,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“If thou have not guards in front and rear to keep off the crowd,</div>

<p class="unindent">Farzanah Bahrám relates in the <cite>Sharistan</cite>, that Kaiván
expressed himself after this manner: “The connexion
of my spirit with this body, formed of the
elements, resembles the relation of the body to a
loose robe; whenever I wish I can separate myself
from it, and resume it at my desire.” The
same author also thus relates of him, in the text of
the <span class="title">Jam-i-Kai Khusró</span>, wherein are recounted some
of his revelations and spiritual communications:</p>

<p>Kaivan was master of noble demonstrations and
subtile distinctions: one of the Moslem lawyers having
asked him: “Why dost thou forbid thy followers
from eating flesh, slaying animals, and injuring
living creatures?” He thus replied: “The seekers
of God are named the peculiar people of the
<a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 96</span>
heart; and the heart itself, the true Kâabah:
therefore, what is an abomination in the sanctuary
formed of water and clay cannot a fortiori be suitable
to the true Kâabah: that is, the eating of
animals and the slaughter of living creatures. A
great man says:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“I have heard that a sheep once thus addressed the butcher,</div>
  <div class="i0">At the moment he prepared to cut off her head with his sword:</div>

  <div class="i0">What then shall that person not experience who eats my fatted loin?’”</div>
 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>Kaivan also said: “If you think proper, keep your
tenets secret wherever you happen to be, concealing
them even from your brethren in the faith;
as they, for the confirmation of their system, will
make you publicly known.” Azizi also says:</p>

<div class="poem-container">

<p>Some one asked him: “In the schism of Abad
Ansari, which faith shall I adopt, and whose
arguments must I regard as true?” Azar Kaiván
replied: “Remain in the same faith that, until the
present time, God doeth as seemeth good to him;
and for the time to come he will do whatever he
thinks proper.” Urfi of Shiraz

He once said to a holy man: “The knowledge of
evanescent objects is not properly knowledge, but
bears the same relation to reality as the mirage
of the desert to water: the searcher after which
obtains nothing but an increase of thirst.” Shah
Subhan says:</p>

<p>They once observed to Kaivan: “Notwithstanding
the great exertions made by his highness the sincere
and faithful Akbar, and the grand justiciary,
the caliph Omar, and the possessor of the two
lights, Osman, in the way of the faith proved by
miracles, and their mighty labors in diffusing its
institutes, the Shee-ites are opposed to these
great personages?” He replied: “The mass of
mankind are acted upon by time and place, in
opposition to the seekers after truth. It is also
to be observed that the people of Iran have adopted
the Shee-ite faith; and as the above-mentioned
great personages destroyed the fire-temples of
that nation, and overturned their ancient religion,
therefore rebellion and envy have remained in
their hearts.”</p>

<p>Two learned men having a dispute concerning the
superiority of the chosen Alí, “the Elect” (whose
<a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 98</span>
face may God honor), over the two Shaikhs and the
<span class="title">Lord of the two lights</span> (Osmar), (upon all of whom
be the mercy of the Almighty) having referred the
dispute to Kaivan, he observed:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">

<p>“The distinction between the two exalted parties
is difficult, as two of them claim supremacy on the
celebrity (drum) of being fathers-in-law to the
Arab founder of religion; and the other two are
fitted for dignity, by being sons-in-law to the
apostle of the Arabs. But whereas all things are
objects of the Almighty’s regard, the excellent
Alí, ‘the Lion of God,’ was esteemed so pre-eminent
an object of divine favor among the Moslems,
that want of faith and ignorance induced many
to worship him as the true God, until this great
personage openly disclaimed such a pretension.
Also during the pontificate and caliphat of <span class="person">Sadik</span>,
‘the faithful witness,’ the powerful <span class="person">Abubeker</span>,
‘the separator,’ the grand <span class="person">Omar</span>, and that of <span class="person">Zu-l-Narain</span>,
‘the Lord of the two Lights,’ error
misled many to such a degree, that they denied
their authority, until these legitimate directors
asserted their claims to that
dignity.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_323" id="fnanchor_323"></a><a href="#footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 99</span>
He returned an answer of a similar description in
a dispute between a Jew, a Christian, and a Muselman,
who were arguing about the superiority of their
<a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 100</span>
respective prophets; some acknowledging Jesus as
God, the others as the Son of God. One day as a
Christian and Muselman were disputing with each
<a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 101</span>
other, the former allowing the death of Jesus, and
the latter believing him to be alive, Azar Kaivan
said: “If a person who knew not the direction of
a road which formed his destination, should in
the course of his journey come to a dead body
lying down, and a living person seated, from
which of the two ought he to inquire his way?”
As the disputants both replied, “from the living
person;” he then said to the Muselman: “Adopt
thou the faith of Jesus, as according to thy belief
he is living.” He then added: “By life is meant
the life of the rational soul: in this Mohammed
and Jesus are on an equality; call your prophets
the ‘eternal living:’ for life means not the perpetuity
of this body fashioned out of the elements,
which cannot accompany us beyond a hundred
or a hundred and twenty natural stages (years).”

<a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 102</span>
he pronounced a panegyric on the opposition to
sensual passions exhibited by pious Moslem believers:
and then added: “There is no limit to the opposition
to these passions: even the unbeliever through
the practice of austerities finally becomes a Moslem.”
He also added: “An exemplary unbeliever
had become able to work miracles: a Shaikh
went to him one day and asked: ‘By what route
hast thou attained to this dignity?’ He replied,
‘By opposing the suggestions of the passions.’
On which the Shaikh answered: ‘Now turn to
Islamism, as thy soul has admitted infidelity.’
On hearing which the unbeliever became a follower
of Islamism.” Kaivan observed: “The
Shaikh must have been an infidel, as his soul was
still seeking after Islamism, or the true religion.”
Urfi says:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“Lay aside the recollection of (these words) belief and unbelief, as they excite great disputes;</div>

<p>A person once came to Zu-l-Ulum, and said: “I
propose embracing the profession of a durvesh,
and breaking asunder the chains which bind me
to the world.” Kaivan replied, “It is well.”
Some days after, he returned to Kaivan, and said:
“I am at present engaged in procuring the patched
tunic, cap, wallet, and other things necessary for
<a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 103</span>
my profession.” Zu-l-Ulum observed: “The
profession of a durvesh consists in resigning every
thing and abandoning all manner of preparations,
and not in accumulation of any kind.”</p>

<p>A merchant through penury having assumed the
dress of hypocrisy, appeared in a Shaikh’s garb,
and many persons devoutly regarded him as a holy
man. He one day came before Kaivan and said:
“Often have wretches plundered me on the road:
it was however for a good purpose, in order that
by embracing the life of a durvesh I might attain
the great object of salvation.” Azar Kaivan replied:
“Be not grieved, as thou art now plundering
mankind by way of retaliation.”</p>

<p>At present some of Kaivan’s disciples, as far as
the author’s acquaintance extends, are about to be
enumerated.</p>

<p><span class="person">Farzanah Kharrád</span>, of the family of Mahbud, who
had been the <span class="title">khan salar</span> (royal table-decker or taster)
to the equitable monarch
<span class="person">Nushirvan</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_325" id="fnanchor_325"></a><a href="#footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></span>
and put to
<a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 104</span>
death through the sorcery of a Jew and the calumnies
of a chamberlain, as recorded in the Shah
Namah of the king of poets, Ferdúsi, and in other
histories: Kharrad joined himself to Kaivan in the
bazar of Shiraz, and practised religious austerities
for many years. Farzanah Khushi has often mentioned
in conversation, and has also frequently
repeated in the <span class="title">Bazm-gah-i-Durvéshán</span>, “the Durvesh’s
banquetting-room,” the following circumstance:
“I one day beheld <span class="person">Kharrad</span> and <span class="person">Ardeshir</span>
(a descendant of <span class="person">Ardeshir
Babegan</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_326" id="fnanchor_326"></a><a href="#footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></span>
and one of
Kaivan’s disciples), standing face to face and mutually
opposing each other: whenever Ardeshir
<a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 105</span>
wished to smite Kharrád with a sword, he appeared
like a stone, so that when the sword came
into contact with his body, it was instantly broken
to pieces.”&mdash;In the year 1029 of the Hejirah
(1620 A. D.) he became reunited to the pure uncompounded
spirit. <span class="person">Buzurgi</span> says:</p>

<p><span class="person">Farzanah Farshid wird</span> was one of the Parsi village
chieftains: his pedigree ascended to <span class="person">Farzanah
Shedosh</span>, who was one of the fifth <span class="person">Sassan</span>’s<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_327" id="fnanchor_327"></a><a href="#footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></span> disciples.
He also became attached to Azar Kaivan in the same
place as Kharrad, and devoted himself to the service
of the Almighty. Khushi relates as follows: “Farshid
wird and Bahman used to stand facing each
<a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 106</span>
other; every arrow which Bahman discharged
against Farshid wird, he used to cut in two with
his sword: and whenever the latter let fly an
arrow, Bahman with activity and address threw
himself to one side and avoided it. But this is
still more wonderful: whenever Bahman shot off
a musket, Farshid let fly one at the same instant,
and ball met ball, so that they both remained
unhurt: sometimes also when Farshid Wird shot
off his musket, Bahman used to move rapidly on
one side.” In the year 1029 of the Hejirah
(A. D. 1619) he hurried away from this abode of
the elements to the skies. The Khajah Hafiz speaking
on this subject, says:</p>

<div class="poem-container">

  <div class="i0">But remains for ever stamped on the records of our eternal world.”</div>

<p><span class="person">Farzanah Khíradmand</span> was descended from Sám,
the son of Narimán: he joined <span class="person">Zu-l-Ulum</span> and gave
himself up to religious austerities. Khushi thus
relates: “I once beheld Khiradmand while standing
face to face to <span class="person">Rustam</span> (who was descended from

disciples), assume the form of a dragon,
and shower out fire from his mouth, to such a
degree that a strong palm was consumed by its
violence.”</p>

<p>In three months after Bahman’s death, Khiradmand
was restored to his original place. <span class="person">Buzurgi</span>

<p>Of these illustrious personages they have recorded
many miraculous and mysterious deeds; such as,
in the upper world, hiding the sun’s disk; causing
him to appear at night; making the stars visible in
the day-time: and in this lower world, walking on
the surface of water; making trees productive out
of season; restoring verdure to dried-up wood;
causing trees to bow down their heads; also showing
themselves between heaven and earth in the form of
lightning; and such like: and, in the animated
world, metamorphosing animals; rendering themselves
<a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 108</span>
invisible to men; appearing under various
shapes and forms: some of which wonders have been
recorded in the <span class="title">Bazmgah-i-Durveshi Khushí</span>. They
relate that these great personages were to such a
degree enabled to divest themselves of corporeal
elements, that they quitted the body at pleasure:
also that they had acquired from the court of Heaven
the knowledge of all sciences whether known or
occult, and <em>consequently</em> had the power of exhibiting
such wonderful works; having rendered, by the
efficacy of their austerities, elementary matter subject
to themselves. The author of these pages
beheld these four holy personages, Kharrad, Farshid
wird, Bahman, and Khiradmand, in Patna, on
which occasion they bestowed their benedictions,
and imparted to him the glad tidings of the means
of obtaining the great object, or final salvation.

<p><span class="person">Farzanah Bahram</span>, the son of Farhad, was descended
from <span class="person">Gudarz</span>, the son of Hashwád. When
Azar Kaivan had proceeded to Patna, in this sage’s
latter days, Farzanah Bahram came from Shiraz
and devoted himself to the practice of religious austerities.
He was a man who had attained the highest
degree of knowledge in logic, natural philosophy,
the abstract sciences, and theology, which he had
<a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 109</span>
most attentively studied as far as set forth and expounded
by sound reasoning in the Parsi, Pehlevi,
and Arabic: in practical and theoretical science he
was unequalled; being profoundly skilled and a
perfect philosopher in all the objects of science and
morality: among the Moslem doctors, he had established
the relations of external tuition with <span class="person">Khajah
Jumál-Uddin Mahmúd</span>, one of the disciples of the
<span class="person">Mulla Jalál Dawani</span>. Farzánah Bahrám is the polished
author and compiler of the book entitled
<cite>Sharístán-í-Dánish, wa Gulístán-í-Binish</cite>, “the
pavilion of knowledge and the rose-garden of
vision.” In the <span class="title">Sharistan</span>, he thus tells us:
“Through the aid of Azar Kaivan, I reached the
invisible, the angelic, the empyrean worlds,
and the seat of the Divinity, and attained to
union with him through revelations of the fourfold
kind&mdash;<dfn>impressive</dfn>, <dfn>operative</dfn>, <dfn>attributive</dfn>, and
<dfn>essential</dfn>.” The Mobed <span class="person">Hoshyar</span> relates: “I
have heard Farzánah Bahrám relate as follows:
I was one day standing in the presence of Azar
Kaivan, and conceived in my heart the wish
that he should tell me what occupied my secret
thoughts. The venerable personage unfolded the
secret thoughts of my heart, and afterwards said:
‘O, Farzanah! it is an easy matter for me to
know the secrets of the soul; but then what
purpose does thy tongue answer? in order
<a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 110</span>
that thy tongue may not be useless, I shall for
the future suffer thee to speak.’” He assumed
the dress of a merchant, but people imagined it
was for the purpose of concealment, and that he
gave himself up to alchymy. In the year of the
Hejirah 1034 (A. D. 1624), he ascended from this
lower abode of darkness to the pavilions of light.
The sage Sunái says:</p>

“the songs of the intoxicated.” He was
born at the port of Surat; he traced his pedigree to
the invincible champion Rustam, the son of Zál,
and was a man of exceeding bravery, heroism, and
experience; perfect in generosity, sagacity, the
termination of disputes, right reason, and sound
experience. If his history were detailed at full

<p>In short he entered the service of the great philosopher
Azar Kaivan and his eminent disciples, being
associated with them in the doctrine of self-knowledge;
from the commencement of night to the rise
of the world-illuminating sun, he slept in the attitude
<a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 111</span>
of <dfn>Murdah Khasp</dfn>. Now the terms <dfn>Muráah
Khab</dfn>, <dfn>Murdap Khasp</dfn>, and <dfn>Sáónós</dfn>, are terms applied
by the Sipásían to the following mode of sleeping:
the devotee rests (having thrown his legs beneath
him) on his knees, pressing to the ground both
heels as far as the great toe: and applying the extremities
of the knees to the earth, he keeps his seat
on the same; he is then to lie on his back, keeping
the points of his fingers on his head; after this, he is
to look intently between the eye-brows, and carry
into practice the <dfn>Habs-i-dam</dfn>, or imprisonment of
the breath. The Durvesh Subahani, one of the great
Sufees, used to say: “Such was the sleep of the
prophets.” They also say: “The prophets of old
used to sleep on their backs, with their faces directed
towards the Heavens:” which is the same
as the position before described. Hoshyar had attained
to the power of suppressing the breath for
one watch (three hours). Shaikh Saadi says:</p>

<div class="poem-container">

  <div class="i0b">“They who restrain the soul from sensual pleasures</div>
  <div class="i0">Surpass in heroism both Rustam and Zál.”</div>
 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>Hoshyar was not scrupulous about what he ate;
never turning away his face from whatever was set
before him: he however most diligently shunned
the practice of cruelty to living creatures, and avoided
superfluities and excess of every description. Hafiz
of Shiraz on this head says:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 112</span>

<p>In the year of the Hejirah 1050 (A. D. 1640) he

year of the Hejirah 1036 (A. D. 1626) the author of
this work met him in the delightful region of Kashnim.
He used to support himself on the extremities
of his fingers, so that his body came not into contact
with the ground, in which position he continued
from midnight until dawn. On the subject of
penance Hafiz says:</p>

<p>The Mobed <span class="person">Sarósh</span>, the son of Kaiván, the son of
Kamkar, who was styled <span class="title">Namdár</span>, or “the illustrious,”
on account of the celebrity of his knowledge.
The Mobed carried his lineage on the father’s
side to the venerable prophet <span class="person">Zardúsht</span>, and on his
mother’s, to <span class="person">Jamásp</span> the Sage. He was equally conversant
with the theoretical and practical sciences;
and was master of the languages of Arabia, Persia,
and Hindustan; he had travelled over most of the
habitable world; his nights were passed in prayer;
his conduct was always pure. On coming into attendance
on Kaiván, he was illuminated by the sun of
his knowledge, and during his attendance on Farzanah
Bahrám, the son of Farhád, he acquired the
Arabic language. His age reached to sixty years;
in short he was a saint elect, who in the course of
his life never looked on a woman; his mouth was
never polluted with animal food of any description;
<a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 114</span>
he sought seclusion from the world, and limited himself
to a small quantity of food.</p>

medicine;” the <span class="title">Sagangubín</span>, “dog’s honey,” and
the <span class="title">Zerdúsht Afshar</span>, “the companion of Zerdúsht,”
and such like. It was heard from an eminent doctor,
named <span class="person">Muhammed Mahsan</span>, who said thus: “I
heard from him <a name="Kaivan" id="Kaivan"></a>(Kaiván) three hundred and sixty
proofs confirmatory of the existence of the Deity:
but when I wished to commit them to writing, it
was no longer in my power.” People relate all
manner of miraculous stories about him; such as his
creating what was not previously in existence; revealing
secret matters, and concealing what was
evident; the acceptance or fulfilment of his prayers;
his performing a long journey in a short space of
time; his knowledge of things hidden from the
senses; and his giving a description of the same;
his appearing at the same time in places far distant
from each other; bringing the dead to life, and
depriving the living of vitality; his being enabled to
hear and understand the language of animals, vegetables,
minerals, etc.; to produce food and wine
without any visible means; to walk on the surface
of water, also through fire and air; and such like.

The author met him in Kashmir in the year of the
Hejirah 1036 (A. D. 1627).</p>

<p><span class="person">Firrah Kárí</span>, the attendant on the venerable <span class="person">Shídósh</span>
(an account of whom shall be soon given) was
a person, whose essence was adorned with science
and decorated by purity; the possessor of extraordinary
probity and sound understanding, said thus:
“I once received some injury from the peasantry of
Achán, a district bordering on the public and
sacred place of Kashmír: speaking of this to <span class="person">Yazdán
Silái</span>, a disciple attached to the Móbed Sarósh,
I said ‘the people of Achán have grievously afflicted
me,’ and stated to him the criminal conduct
of this wicked set of men. He answered:
‘Do you wish that the Almighty should overwhelm
with floods the cultivated grounds of
these wretches?’ I replied ‘Certainly.’ It
then began to rain so exceedingly, the loftiest and
strongest-built houses were overthrown; from the
overwhelming deluge ruin fell on their buildings
and tilled grounds; and the fields of these men
themselves were nearly destroyed by the waters
at the very commencement.” The Maulavi Mânevi
says:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“As long as the heart of the righteous comes not to affliction,</div>
  <div class="i0">God never brings calamity on any people.”</div>
 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>The rains still continued, which Sarósh having
<a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 116</span>
observed, he was exceedingly wroth with his disciple
and reproved him; and that same day the rain ceased.
Firrah-Kári used to say, “Mobed Sarósh was acquainted
with the desires of my heart, and possessed
power over men’s minds.” He also related
the following story concerning him: “At the time
of arriving in the caravanserai of Bálik, in the
city of Tarkhan, the men of that place wished
to act wickedly towards us, and practise oppression.
I explained the nature of their conduct to
the Mobed, on which he retired into a corner. That
same night there appeared in the air men whose
heads reached to the heavens, whilst their feet
touched the earth. The people of the city were
seized with consternation and desisted from oppressing
us, and the merchants at the same time
bestowed freedom on those who had been captives
for many years.” The Mobed Húshyár relates: “Being in want of
a few direms, I went to Yazdán Sitái, the disciple
of the Mobed Sarósh; on this he stretched forth
his hand, and taking up some broken pottery,
formed twenty heaps of it: having breathed on
these a few times, they all became gold Mohurs:
these he put into my hands, and I disbursed them
in the course of my ordinary expenses.” He also
relates: “Yazdán Sitái constructed a house of
such a kind that, when any one entered, he beheld
<a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 117</span>
the sun; and when the holy man sat with
his friends, he appeared as a crocodile coming to
the river-bank, which was about to snatch away
all present. He sometimes threw into the fire
towels on which the flames had no effect: he
frequently repeated something, stirring his lips,
and so rendered himself invisible; he used sometimes
to appear in the air, and used to say: ‘I
am actually at rest, although I appear otherwise.’”
<span class="person">Shidosh</span>, the son of <span class="person">Anosh</span>, said: “We
were once seated near him when he placed a taper
in a basin of water; there immediately appeared
some peacocks turning towards the water, plunging
their heads into it, and displaying all their
beauty, whilst we remained in utter astonishment.”
Shidosh also says: “I once beheld him
disporting in the midst of a blazing fire.” Nay, the
writer of these pages has seen him swallow fire.
The Mobed Húshyár says: “He once exhibited a
sight, so as to make a house appear filled with
serpents and scorpions.” He used also to lay
on the breast of a person plunged in sleep, something
of such a nature as to make him return an
answer to every question proposed to him. The
Mobed Húshyár also relates: “I once beheld the
Hakim (the Sage) Kamran of Shiraz, in the feast
of joy and hospitality made for the reception of an
Iraki friend, light a match: on this, all the
Lulees<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_333" id="fnanchor_333"></a><a href="#footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a></span>
<a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 118</span>
then in the house stripped themselves naked
and began to dance, whilst we looked on at a
distance. The sage said: ‘This we have learnt
from Yazdan Sitái: as I give no invitation to
Lulees, and no others can be prevailed on to
commit such indecency, I therefore tried the
experiment on the party of them assembled in
this place.’” Many other things of a similar
nature are related concerning Yazdan Sitái.</p>

<p><span class="person">Khoda Jói</span> was a native of Herat, who had passed
many years in the service of exemplary and holy
men; he relates: “I once saw in a vision holy
personages come around me and say: ‘Depart
and seek a spiritual guide free from prejudice.’
During many years’ search I was unable to discover
such a character; but having once seen in
a dream, ‘that Azar Kaiván of Istakhar was one of
that description:’ I went near him in company
with <span class="person">Farzanah Khushi</span>.”</p>

<p>Khoda Jói excelled in the knowledge of Parsi
and Arabic; he avoided altogether animal food of
every description; he could suppress his breath during
four watches (twelve hours), and was in the
habit of practising the Hubs-i-dam; he never slept
at night, nor ate more than fifty direms weight of
<a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 119</span>
food. He never gave utterance to a lie, and whatever
he stated had reference to exalted objects and
pursuits: even these were uttered only at the solicitation
of his friends. He is the author of the
volume entitled <span class="title">Jám-i-Kai Khusró</span>, “the cup of
Kai Khusró,” an admirable commentary on the
poetic compositions of Azar Kaiván, and also containing
his visions. He arrived in the delightful
regions of Kashmir in the year of the Hejirah 1040
(A. D. 1631), where the author met him: in that
same year this distinguished personage hastened
from this abode of evanescence to the mansions of
eternity. Hafiz of Shiraz says:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“O joyous day, when I depart from this abode of desolation;</div>

  <div class="i0">Fluttering about like a solar mote in the <em>atmosphere</em> of that lip,</div>
  <div class="i0">Until I attain at last to the fountain-head of the radiant sun.”</div>
 </div>

<p>The Mobed Khushi is the author of the <span class="title">Bazm-Gah</span>
(or “banqueting house”), in which treatise when
describing the stations of Azar Kaiván’s illustrious
disciples and most eminent followers, who are twelve
in number; he enumerates them in this order: <span class="person">Ardashír</span>,
<span class="person">Kharad</span>, <span class="person">Shiroíyah</span>, <span class="person">Khiradmand</span>, <span class="person">Farhad</span>,
<span class="person">Suhrab</span>, <span class="person">Azádah</span>, <span class="person">Bizhen</span>,
<span class="person">Isfendiar</span>, <span class="person">Farshidwird</span>,
<a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 120</span>
<span class="person">Bahman</span> and <span class="person">Rustam</span>: the daily food of each of these
individuals was much below ten direms weight:
and they carried the austerities recommended by
Kaiván to the utmost limit, so that no others of his
disciples attained to the same rank as these twelve
persons. Of Farhád, Farshídwird, and Bahman,
some account has been given in the preceding part
of this work.</p>

<p>In the <span class="title">Bazm-gah</span>, Khushi thus states respecting
himself: “In the days of my youth, it was my anxious
desire to find <em>a spiritual guide</em>. I therefore
had recourse to the eminent doctors of Iran, Turan,
Room, and Hindustan; that is, to Moslems,
Hindoos, Guebers, Christians, and Jews. They
all said to me: ‘Quit thy present faith and pass
over to us:’ but my heart felt no inclination to
change of religion, to adopting another, and abandoning
opinions, as they did not afford me sufficient
light in the object of my pursuit.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“Whilst a person beholds not the water, why pull off his slippers?”</div>
 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>“Such is the language of the prejudiced; although
each of these doctors praised himself as being free
from its influence: I afterwards beheld, in a vision,
a mighty river from which streams and canals
issued forth, all of which after many windings
returned back into the same great river, and were
confined within its two banks. I abandoned the
<a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 121</span>
great water, and in order to allay my thirst, directed
my steps towards the rivulets in search of
water: but as the banks of their channels were
difficult of access through slime and mud, and carrying
a bowl,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_335" id="fnanchor_335"></a><a href="#footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></span>
I could not reach the stream, and
remained in great perplexity. At length my father
came up and said: ‘Entreat God to conduct
thee to the water.’ A voice then reached my
ear: ‘This man has abandoned the river, and
directed his face towards the rivulets.’ On my
directing my steps towards the river, a blessed
Angel said to me: ‘The great river is Azar Kaiván;
the small rivulets are the doctors.’ I then
knew that the slime and mud of the banks, the
bowl, and the rivulets refer to prejudice and envy:
therefore, being accompanied by Khoda Jói, I
joined myself to Azar Kaiván, and discovered the
object of my inquiries.” Hafiz of Shiraz observes:</p>

<div class="poem-container">

<p><span class="person">Farzanah Bahram</span>, the son of Farhád, was called
Bahram the Less: the <span class="title">Arzhang Máni</span> (the gallery of
Máni) is the production of his genius: he was in
attendance on Zu-al-Ulum, but attained to communion
<a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 122</span>
with God and to perfection, in the service of
Farzanah Bahram, the son of Farhad. In the year
of the Hejirah 1048 (A. D. 1638) the compiler of
these pages met with Bahram the Less, the son of
Farhad, in the imperial city of Lahore, in perfect
health, but in the same year that sage bade adieu to
this world. He was a man who found repose in
God, and avoided all intercourse with society: he
was learned in all the theoretical and practical sciences,
and eminently conversant with the languages
of Arabia, Persia, Hindustan, and Europe: by him
were translated into Persian, that is, into Parsi
mixed with Arabic, the works of the Shaikh <span class="person">Ishrák
Shuháb ud dín Maktúl</span>, which treated of the Ishrakian
tenets; his time was employed in transcribing
books, from which source he was obliged to derive
his scanty support. He never slept at night; in
the year of the Hejirah 1048 (A. D. 1638) the author
beheld him with Húshyár at Lahore; during the
entire night, the writer of these pages sat in his presence,
and from morn until evening Húshyár remained
before him; whilst the above-mentioned
Farzanah, seated on both knees, with his face to the
east, never moved: people have witnessed in him
many things of this description. They say that he
used to remain seated two or three days after this
fashion, neither eating bread nor drinking water; he
never laid his back on the ground; his food consisted
<a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 123</span>
of a small quantity of cow’s milk; his lips were never
polluted with any other substance, and even this he
swallowed at intervals of two or three days.</p>

<p>The Mobed Paristár, the son of Khurshíd, who
was originally of Isfashán, assumed the elements of
body in Patna; the Mobed, when a youth, was
accepted by divine favour, and through the aid of
the Almighty became one of the <span class="title">Yekánah Bín</span>, or
“seers of unity.” Having in his early years entered
into the service of Azar Kaiván, he obtained a perfect
sanctity through the society of his holy master’s
disciples. He however devoted himself chiefly to
the Mobed Sarósh: he was the author of the <cite>Taprah-i-Mobedi</cite>,
or “the Sacerdotal Kettledrum.” In
the year of the Hejirah 1049 (A. D. 1640) he
came to Kashmir, where the author of this work
was admitted into his society. From the nightfal
until sunrise, the Mobed Paristár gave himself
up to the Saráíst, which in the celestial language,
or the <span class="title">Desatir</span>, they call <dfn>Faró</dfn>, or “downward:”
this rite, according to them, consists in
elevating the feet in the air, and standing on the
head; which position is called in Hindi <span class="title">Kapal
Asan</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_336" id="fnanchor_336"></a><a href="#footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></span>
<a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 124</span>
or “head-seat.” He of a sudden quitted the body and
entered the bowers of Paradise. A Mobed has said:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“If thou be a wanderer upon the path of spirituality,</div>
  <div class="i0">Fix not on the (external) robe, the motion of thy heart,</div>

<p>The Mobed Peshkár, the son of Khurshíd, was
also born in Patna, and one year younger than Perishtar
(his brother). He became unrivalled during
his age, in the Hindi chaunts and poems of that sect.
He was the <em>servant of the leader</em> Azar Kaiván and
his disciples, and whilst in the service of the Mobed
Sarósh he attained the knowledge of God, and of
himself, and he became eminently divested of prejudice
and exempted from human infirmities: being
totally unfettered by the bonds or chains of any sect
whatever, and studiously shunning the polemic domains
of prejudice: in short, the eulogium of one
creed and the abhorrence of another, entered not
into his system. He came to Kashmir with his elder
brother, with the purpose of departing from thence
to Kathay: he was noted for the imprisonment of the
breath, concerning which the Mobed Húshíyár said:
“He once suppressed his breath and plunged into
the water, where he remained immersed during
two watches (six hours), after which interval he
again raised his head above the surface.”</p>

<span class="person">Shídosh</span>, the son of Anosh, descended from the
prophet Zardusht by his father Anósh, who was
styled <dfn>Farhosh</dfn>, “the splendor of intellect,” was one
of the sincerely devoted disciples of Azar Kaiván:
<span class="person">Zarbád</span> was also descended from the same divine
apostle Zardúsht, and finally became a man of opulence,
although at the beginning of his career he
only possessed the pangs of destitution. They both
came one day into the presence of Azar Kaiván, and
lamented the hardship of their forlorn state; on this
Azar replied: “Proceed with a small stock to the
quarter of sunrise, traverse the eastern borders,
and dispose of it with speed towards the descending
sun, as your condition, through this depressed
site of difficulty will be changed into the means
of affluence.” Nearly at the period of giving these
instructions, Azar Kaiván having withdrawn from
this earthly tabernacle, hastened to the resting-place
of the spheres, and these two Jupiter-like stars, the
unrivalled splendor of the world, set out as directed.
At length, through the efficacy of Kaiván’s enlightened
spirit, the state of these pilgrims continued to
obtain an ascendancy, until they became possessed
of great opulence. Hafiz says thus:</p>

<div class="poem-container">

<p>After this, <span class="person">Zarbádí</span> sent to Patna an ancient servant,
Farrah Kari by name, to conduct his daughter
<a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 126</span>
to the musk-scented pavilion of Shídósh, the
illustrious son of Anósh. After this event, Farrah
Kari and Shídósh, proceeded from Patna on a commercial
adventure, and formed the plan of setting
out from Kashmir to Kashgar: they were however
obliged to remain some time in Kashmir: but on the
first moment of moving from Patna, there arose in
the breast of Shídósh an anxious wish for attaining
the knowledge of himself, the investigation of his
ancient abode, ascertaining his natural light, and
exploring the march of the invisible world: as from
the very first, this bright Jupiter, through the entreaty
of Kaivan (Saturn) had directed his steps to
the region of atoms and the abode of elements of the
celestial and terrestrial parents: consequently, when
Kaivan had abandoned this bodily frame, he sat down
with his disciples,</p>

<div class="poem-container">

  <div class="i0b">“Choose thou companions who are better than thyself,</div>
  <div class="i0">In order that thy understanding and faith may increase.”</div>
 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>He consequently devoted himself to religious exercises,
listening in the first place to the voice called
in Persian <dfn>âzád ává</dfn> “the independent voice,” in
Arabic, <dfn>saut-i-mutluk</dfn>, or “the absolute sound;”
and in Hindi, <dfn>anáhid</dfn>. When he had duly practised
this rite, he directed his eyes, opened wide between
the eyebrows, which in Hindi they call <dfn>terátuk</dfn>, until
the blessed form of Kaiván was clearly manifested:
he next contemplated that form, until it actually was
<a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 127</span>
never more separated from him; he at last reached
the region of intellect, and having passed through the
six worlds, arrived in the seventh, and in this state
of entrancement obtained admittance to the Almighty
presence; so that, during this abstraction from self,
the annihilation (of every thing human) and the eternity
(of the spiritual) was joined to his existence.

<p>One morning at the dawn of day he said thus to
the author of the Dabistan: “Yesterday in the
gloom of night, directed by the light of spirit, I
departed from this external body, and arrived at
the mysterious illumination ever replete with effulgence:
the chamberlain of truth removed from
before me the curtains, so that on quitting this
mortal nature and leaving the visible world, I
traversed the angelic sphere. The supreme independently-existing
light of lights became revealed
in all the impressive, operative, attributive,
and essential radiance of glory: this state of imaginary
being disappeared, actual existence was
clearly witnessed.” Hafiz says:</p>

<div class="poem-container">

Shidósh, though far removed from receiving
pleasure by dainty food, still appeared always in
magnificent dresses: his audience always diffused
the fragrance of perfume; he even clad in handsome
dresses his head domestic servants, and other dependents,
nay his very porter and doorkeeper. He
used to say: “My state proceeds from the splendor
of Azar Kaiván’s aid: to feel contempt for such a
capital would be highly improper; and not to
make use of it would be an abomination before
my benefactor; for otherwise, I derive no pleasure
from fine raiment.” As to his abstinence in point
of food, and his shunning of female society, what
has been mentioned is sufficient on these heads.
Shidosh Bihin was a youth of a finely proportioned
person, and beautiful countenance; the following
was the rule observed by him: he never attached
merit to any strange creed, but endeavoured to divest
himself altogether of prejudice, and maintained very
little intercourse with the generality of mankind:
when he formed an intimacy, on the first day he
testified only a small degree of warmth; he exhibited
greater attention on the second; so that he daily
made greater advances in the path of friendship;
progressively increasing his love and affection: as
to what has been stated relative to his displaying no
great degree of warmth on the first interview, the
same proportion obtained when he shewed a decrease
<a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 129</span>
of warmth to some; that same would be reckoned
very great in any other. He always asserted,
that in the society of friends, their intercourse must
not be separated from meditation on God, as whatever
is, is but a radiancy emanating from the sun
of his essence: the visible and invisible of the world
being only forms of that existence. Rafiah says:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“If angels and demons be formed from one principle,</div>
  <div class="i0">The husbandman, the spring, the seed, and the field must be the same:</div>
  <div class="i0">What has his unity to dread from the plurality of the human race?</div>
  <div class="i0">Although you tie the knot a hundred-fold, there is only a single cord.”</div>
 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>Shidosh was seized with so severe an illness in
Kashmir, that his case surpassed the art of the physician:
as Urfi says:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“What physician can there be, if the Messiah himself be taken ill?”</div>
 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>All the people about Shidosh were disconsolate,
but he remained cheerful of heart, and in proportion
as the symptoms became more aggravated, his
cheerfulness increased, and he frequently recited
these couplets from Hafiz:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“O joyous day, when I depart from this abode of desolation,</div>
  <div class="i0">Seeking the repose of my soul, and setting out in search of my beloved:</div>
  <div class="i0">Dancing like a solar mote around the atmosphere of her lips,</div>
  <div class="i0">Until I reach the fountain-head of the radiant
   sun.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_337" id="fnanchor_337"></a><a href="#footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></span></div>
 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>On the day of his departure from this temporary
halting-place to the eternal mansion of repose and
the exalted seat of happiness, his disconsolate friends
<a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 130</span>
and affectionate domestics were deeply afflicted; but
Shidosh retained his cheerfulness and thus addressed
them with an expression of delight: “I am not
grieved at this disease of body, why then do you
grieve? nay ought you not to wish that I, having
quitted this gloomy abode of phantasy, should
hasten to one beyond the confines of space, and
the mansions of intellect may become united to
the truly existent and independent (first cause).”
The Maulavi Mânavi says thus:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i2b">“If death be a human being, say to him, ‘draw near,’</div>
  <div class="i2">That I may closely fold him in a fond embrace.</div>
  <div class="i2">From him I extort by force eternal life,</div>
  <div class="i0">Whilst he but snatches from me the Durvish’s party-colored dress.”</div>
 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>He then lifted up his hands and directing his face
to heaven, the Kiblah of prayer, recited the following
blessed couplets front the <span class="title">Sahifah al Auliya</span>,
“volume of the Saints,” written by the Imam <span class="person">Muhammed
Nur Baksh</span>.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">

  <div class="i0">Still do we want to be guided, on account of the infancy of our steps.</div>
  <div class="i2">We are but solitary drops from the ocean of existence,</div>
  <div class="i2">However much we possess of divine revelation and proof.</div>

 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 131</span>
On reciting these lines he closed his eyes. The
Shaikh Abúlfaiz Faiyazi says on this subject:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“The drop became a fountain, and the fountain grew into a river,</div>
  <div class="i0">Which river became reunited to the ocean of eternity.”</div>
 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>This event occurred in the year of the Hejirah
1040 (A. D. 1629): his affectionate friends expressed
their grief in the following manner:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“Thy brilliant hues still exist in the parterre,</div>
  <div class="i0">Thy fragrance still survives in the jessamine;</div>
  <div class="i0">The sight of thee is put off to the day of resurrection;</div>
  <div class="i0">It is well: but it forms the theme of many a tale.”</div>
 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>The author also in his elegy on Shídósh thus
expresses his grief:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i4">“Since Shídósh departed from my sight</div>
  <div class="i0">That which was a receptacle of eyes became a receptacle of rivers;</div>
  <div class="i0">Had my eyes been a channel, they would have become a river-bed:</div>
  <div class="i0">The resting place of the bird was the paradisian sphere:</div>
  <div class="i0">From this lowly nest he departed to the nest on high.</div>
  <div class="i0">He was truly free and sought no stores except those of holy freedom.</div>
  <div class="i0">He abandoned his body to corporeal matter, and his spirit joined the spiritual region.</div>
  <div class="i0">His soul was united to the sublime being, the creator of souls,</div>
  <div class="i0">Soaring beyond the limits of heaven, earth, and time.”</div>
 </div>

<p>If the author attempted to describe the learned
and pious Abádíyán who were seen in the <span class="title">Dadistan
Aursah</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_339" id="fnanchor_339"></a><a href="#footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></span>
this treatise would never be brought to a
conclusion; he now therefore proceeds to mention
<a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 132</span>
some others, who though professing a faith different
from the Yezdánián or Abadíyán, yet walked according
to the institutes of Kaiván’s disciples, and
attained their great object, the knowledge of God:
and although this class is too numerous to be fully
described, a few of the eminent personages are now
about to be mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="person">Mahummed Alí</span>, of Shiraz was the fellow-student
of Shah Futtah Allah, and he traced his family to
Azar Kaiván: he however attained perfection through
the society of Farzanah Bahram, the son of Farhád,
and had also traversed the seven climes. A thief
came to his house one night, on perceiving whom
Muhammed Alí pretended to fall asleep on his carpet,
so that the robber might not suppose him to
be awake, and continue his pursuits without apprehension.
The robber searched the house carefully,
but as all the effects were concealed in a secure place,
he was unable to get at them. On this Muhammed
raising his head, said to him: “I laid myself down
to sleep, that thou mightst accomplish thy desires,
whereas thou art in despair: be no longer
uneasy.” He then arose and pointed out the
place where all the things were stored away: in consequence
of this generous proceeding, the robber
abandoned his infamous profession, and became a
virtuous character.</p>

<p><span class="person">Muhammed Said</span> of Isfahan was a Saiyid descended
<a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 133</span>
from Husain, who attained his great object through
Farzanah Bahram, the son of Farhad. He once said
to the author: “The first time I obtained the honor
of admittance to the audience of the distinguished
Farzanah, he rose up on seeing me, and showed
the proper respect due to an honorable person,
directing me to be seated on the most distinguished
couch. Some time after, entered a naked
Fakir, but Farzanah Bahram moved not from his
place, but pointed him to a seat in the slipper-repository.
I felt this scruple; surely the highest
distinction is due to the Durvish. Farzanah then
turning his face to the wall, which was ornamented
with paintings, said: ‘O, lifeless figure,
thou art seated on high; but external form confers
not distinction; but Durvishes enjoy a rank,
when their bodies are under the control of their
souls,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_340" id="fnanchor_340"></a><a href="#footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></span>
and their souls united with the supreme
object of love; even in this assembly they are
seated with me in my heart.’ On hearing this, I
turned into the right road.” In the year of the
Hejirah 1045 (A. D. 1634), he abandoned this elemental
frame in Lahore.</p>

<p><span class="person">Ashur Beg Karamanlu</span> is also one of those who
obtained the gift of spiritual intelligence through
Farzanah Bahram, the son of Farhad, notwithstanding
<a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 134</span>
the total absence of regular studies: by the
exertion of his innate powers, he, like the other Yekanah
Bin “seers of one God,” attained communion
with God. In the year of the Hejirah 1048 (A. D.
1636) the author conversed with him in Kashmir,
and inquired into the nature of his intercourse with
Bahram. He answered: “I went by way of experiment
to Farzanah, and he thus directed me:
‘Whether alone or in a crowd, in retirement or
in public, every breathing which issues forth
must proceed from the head; and on this point
there must be no inattention.’ He also said:
‘Guard the internal breath as long as thou canst,
directing thy face to the pine-formed heart, until
the invocation be performed by the heart in the
stomach; also thy invocation should be thus:
‘God! God!’ Meditate also on this sentiment:
‘O Lord! none but thou forms the object of my
desire!’ When I had duly practised this, and
found its impressive influence, then from the
bottom of my heart I sincerely sought God.
After some time he enjoined me to practise the
<dfn>Tawajjah-i-Talkín</dfn>, ‘turning to instruction:’ that
is: ‘keep thy soul in the presence of God, divested
of letters and sounds, whether Arabic or
Persian, never removing thy mind from the
‘pine-formed heart.’ By conforming to these
instructions, I have come at last to such a state,
that the world and its inhabitants are but as a
<a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 135</span>
shadow before me; and their very existence as
the appearance of the vapor of the desert.’”</p>

<p>He was truly a man who had entirely withdrawn
from all external employments and concerns; never
mixing with the people of the world. If a person
deposited food before him, he took only the quantity
he thought proper, and gave away the remainder;
he never polluted his hand with money in gold, silver,
or copper; and he frequently passed two or
three days altogether without food and never requested
any thing.</p>

<p><span class="person">Mahmud Beg Timan</span>, so called from the Timan
tribe of Arang in Lahore, joined himself also to
Farzanah Bahram, the son of Farhad, and as the
precepts of that sage were entirely congenial to his
mind, he commenced his religious profession under
him, and became one of the Yekanah Bin, “seer of
one God,” and “knowing God:” thus without the
aid of books he attained to the knowledge of the
Lord, and notwithstanding the absence of written
volumes, discovered the actual road. In the year
of the Hejirah 1048 (A. D. 1637), whilst in Kashmir,
coming out of his cell one day, he saw before him a
wounded dog, moaning piteously; as the animal was
unable to move, he therefore sold the only two
objects he possessed, his carpet for prayer and his
rosary, with the proceeds of which he purchased
remedies for the dog. That same year, he said to
<a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 136</span>
the author: “On the first day of turning my heart
to the mental invocation of God, I had scarcely
performed it ten times, when an evident influence
was manifested: at the moment of the first part,
called <dfn>nafi</dfn>, of the sentence, my human existence
disappeared; at the time of the second, called
<dfn>asbat</dfn>, a determined sign of divine grace became
visible: my sentence was this: ‘There is no God,
but God.’”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_341" id="fnanchor_341"></a><a href="#footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></span>
After this manner, several of this sect,
by the diligent practice of faith, attained to the
knowledge of God.</p>

<p><span class="person">Musa</span> and <span class="person">Harun</span> were two Jews, to whom Farzanah
Bahram, the son of Farhad, gave these names:
they were distinguished by a profound knowledge
of their own faith, and highly celebrated among the
Rabbins, who are a particular sect of Jewish teachers.
On their introduction into Bahram’s society,
they were fascinated by his manners, and through
his system of faith acquired the knowledge of themselves.
They applied themselves to commerce, and
neither in buying or selling did a falsehood proceed
from their lips, as is the custom of merchants. They
have thus recorded: “To whomsoever Bahram, the
son of Farhad, uttered a single word about the
<a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 137</span>
path of religion, he became immediately fascinated
by his manner: also whoever beheld him
felt an attachment to him; even the hardened
infidel who approached him, humbled himself, and
we have often witnessed such events: for example,
the <span class="person">Mulla Muhammed Sáid</span> of Samarkand, who was
our intimate friend, through excess of prejudice
hurried once to revile him: at that moment, Bahram
had retired from Lahore into a burying-ground:
when the Mulla approached, he found
himself irresistibly impelled to run forward and
laid his face on Bahram’s feet: and on Bahram’s
addressing a few words to him, immediately embraced
his faith. I afterwards questioned the
Mulla about the exact nature of this conversion
from infidelity, and he replied: ‘I no sooner
beheld him than I fell at his feet; and when he
addressed a few words to me, I became enraptured
with him.’ The Mullah always styled
Bahram ‘the plunderer of hearts.’”</p>

<p>One day the author asked Musa, “is Kasun thy
brother?” he replied, “people say so.” I then
asked, “who is your father?” he answered, “our
mother knows that.”</p>

<p><span class="person">Antun Bushuyah
Wávaraj</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_342" id="fnanchor_342"></a><a href="#footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a></span>
was a Frank, zealous
in the Christian faith, and also possessed of great
<a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 138</span>
property; through divine aid, he conceived an
attachment to the society of Durvishes, and for
the purpose of acquiring knowledge held frequent
conferences with them: through his having discovered
the path pointed out by the son of Furhad,
he altogether resigned his worldly concerns,
assumed the profession of a
<span class="title">Kalander</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_343" id="fnanchor_343"></a><a href="#footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></span>
and denied
himself the use of clothes: Farzanah always
called him “Messiah.” He used to appear perfectly
naked, and never wore clothes either summer
or winter: he abstained altogether from animals
of every description: he never solicited any thing,
but if a person brought food or drink before him, if
it were not animal food, he would eat part of it. One
day, although an evil-disposed person smote him so
that his limbs were wounded, yet he never even
looked at his oppressor; when his persecutor had
departed, I, the author, came up as the people were
speaking of the injury inflicted on him; on my enquiring
the particulars from himself, he replied:
“I am not distressed for my own bodily suffering,
but that person’s hands and fists must have suffered
so much.” The Imam <span class="person">Kali Warastah</span>, “the
humble,” says:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“If the thorn break in my body, how trifling the pain!</div>
  <div class="i0">But how acutely I feel for the hapless broken thorn!”</div>

<p><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 139</span>
<span class="person">Ram Bhót</span>, a Hindu, was a learned Brahmin of
Benares; on joining the son of Farhad, he desisted
altogether from his former rites, and began to follow
the path pointed out by Bahrám. The Mobed Hoshyar
says: “I have often heard wonderful stories
concerning him; a person named Muhammed Yakub
was so ill, that the physicians having given up
all hopes of his cure, his relations, in their affliction,
had recourse to an ignorant woman who
reckoned herself a skilful personage: I went one
day near Ram Bhót, and found him reposing his
head on his knee, on which this reflection passed
across my mind: ‘if Ram Bhót be one of the elect,
he can tell whether Muhammed Yakub is to remain
or pass away.’ He raised up his head, and
looking on me with a smile, said: ‘God only
knows the hidden secrets; however, Muhammed
Yakub is not to depart: in another week he will
be restored to health.’ And truly the thing
came to pass as he had declared.” Through his
guidance <span class="person">Ram Chand</span>, a Kshatri, one of the chiefs of
the <span class="title">Sahan Sakal</span>, adopted the faith: and through the
instruction of these two individuals, many of their
tribe embraced the independent faith as promulgated
by the son of Farhad. The word
<dfn>Sah</dfn><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_344" id="fnanchor_344"></a><a href="#footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></span>
in Hindi is
applied to “a possessor or powerful person,” and
<a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 140</span>
the <span class="title">Sahkal</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_345" id="fnanchor_345"></a><a href="#footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></span>
are a division of the Kshatri, an Indian
cast or tribe. In reality, if the writer attempted to
enumerate the numbers of different nations who
zealously adopted the doctrines and ritual of Bahram,
this work would become exceedingly prolix; he must
therefore resist from such an undertaking. The
author of these pages has heard from Farzanah Bahram,
the son of Farhad, as stated on the authority
of Farzanah Bahram, the son of Farhad, that one
day the Shaikh <span class="person">Bahá-ud-din Mohammed Amali</span>,
who was a <dfn>Mujtahad</dfn>, “a champion,” of the sectaries
of Alí, came near Kaiván and obtained an interview:
having thus become acquainted with Kaiván’s
perfection and wisdom, he was exceedingly rejoiced
and happy, and recited this tetrastich:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“In the kâbah and the firetemple the perfect saint performed his rounds,</div>
  <div class="i0">And found no trace of any existence (save that of God);</div>
  <div class="i0">As the splendor of the Almighty sheds its rays in every place,</div>
  <div class="i0">Knock thou either at the door of the kâbah or the portals of the temple.”</div>
 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>After this interview, he became the diligent follower
of Kaiván, and resorted to the disciples of the
Master of all Sciences.</p>

<p><span class="person">Mir Abulkasim Fandaraski</span> also, through his intercourse
with Kaiván’s disciples, became an adorer of
the sun, refraining from cruelty towards all living
<a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 141</span>
creatures. It is well known that being once asked:
“Why dost not thou in obedience to the law go on
the pilgrimage to Mecca?” He replied: “I go
not on this account, as I must there slaughter a
sheep with my own hand.” At present the author
proceeds to describe with the pen of truth a summary
of the institutes of the <dfn>Amézish</dfn>, “intercourse,”
held by the Abadian Durveshes with society. Those
who adopt this rule call it the <dfn>Amèzish-i-Farhang</dfn>,
or “the intercourse of science,” and <dfn>Mèzchar</dfn>, or
“Stranger’s remedy.” When a stranger to their
faith is introduced to one of their assemblies, far
from addressing harsh observations to him, they pass
eulogiums on his tenets, approve whatever he says,
and do not omit to lavish on him every mark of attention
and respect: this conduct proceeds from the
fundamental article of their creed, as they are convinced
that in every mode of belief, its followers may
come to God: nay, if those of a different faith should
present them a request respecting some object about
which they disagree, that is, solicit some act by
which they may approach God, they do not withhold
their compliance. They do not enjoin a person
to abandon his actual profession of faith, as
they account it unnecessary to give him useless pain
of mind. Moreover when any one is engaged in
concerns with them, they withhold not their aid
from his society and support, but practise towards
<a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 142</span>
him to the utmost extent of their ability, whatever
is most praiseworthy in this world and the next:
they are also on their guard against indulging in
sentiments of prejudice, hatred, envy, malice, giving
pre-eminence to one faith above another, or adopting
one creed in preference to another. They also
esteem the learned, the Durvishes, the pure of life,
the worshippers of God in every religion, as their
trusty friends; neither styling the generality of mankind
wicked, nor holding worldly-minded persons
in abhorrence: they observe, “what business has
he who desires not this world’s goods to abhor
the world?” for the sentiment of abhorrence can
proceed from the envious alone. They neither communicate
their secrets to strangers, nor reveal what
another communicates to them.</p>

<p>A person named <span class="person">Mihráb</span> was among the disciples
who followed the son of Farhad, in the year of the
Hejirah 1047 (A. D. 1637); the author, who was
then in Kashmir, thus heard from Muhammad Fál
Hasîrî: “I once beheld Mihráb standing in the high
road, at the moment when a Khorasánian, seizing
on an old man by force, obliged him to labor for
him without recompense, and placed a heavy
burden on his head: at this Mihráb’s heart so
burned within him, that he said to the Khorasánian,
‘Withdraw thy hand from this old man,
that I may bear the burden whithersoever thou
<a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 143</span>
desirest.’ The Khorasánian was astonished, but
Mihráb, without paying any farther attention to
this, took the poor man’s load on his head, and
went along with his unjust oppressor, and on his
return from that person’s house showed no symptoms
of fatigue. On my observing to him, ‘This
oppressor has heaped affliction on a holy priest
and judge like thee!’ he replied, ‘What could
a helpless person do? the load must be conveyed
to his house, and he was unable to place
it on his shoulders, as it was unbecoming for him;
nor was he able to give money (which is difficult
to be procured) in payment of his labour: he
of course seized on some one to perform his
work. I applaud him for granting my request,
and feel grateful to the old man for complying
with my wishes, suffering me to take his place,
and transferring his employment to myself.’”</p>

<p>Hafiz of Shiraz thus expresses himself:</p>

<div class="poem-container">

</div><!--end poem-->

<p><span class="person">Máh Ab</span>, the younger brother of the above <span class="person">Mihráb</span>,
was seen by the compiler of this work in attendance
on the son of Farhad, and in the year of the Hejirah
1048 (A. D. 1638) he thus heard from the Mulla
<span class="person">Mahdi</span> of Lahóre: “Bahram having one day sent
him on some errand to the bazar, he happened
to pass by the house of a person in the service of
<a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 144</span>
<span class="person">Alim Uddin</span> of Halsub, styled <span class="title">Wazir Khan</span>; the
soldier was then chastising his slave, saying:
‘Thou hast fraudulently sold one of my captives.’
Máháb coming near the soldier, said to him:
‘Withdraw thy hand from this slave, and accept
me in place of him who has run away.’ Nay, this
request was so importunately urged, that the soldier
finally accepted the offer and desisted from
beating his slave. However, when the soldier had
discovered Máháb’s spiritual gifts, he permitted

him. A week after this event, Farhad said in my
presence, ‘I know not where Máháb is;’ on
which, resting his head on his knees, he directed
his heaven-contemplating attention to the subject,
and the instant after, raising up his head, said:
‘Máháb is in the service of a certain soldier, and
has voluntarily resigned his person to servitude.’
He forthwith proceeded to the soldier’s abode and
brought back Máháb.” Many similar transactions

 Allusion is here made to the four immediate successors of Mohammed;
these were <span class="person">Abubeker</span>, <span class="person">Omár</span>, <span class="person">Osman</span>, and <span class="person">Alí</span>.</p>

<p class="footnote">The first who took the title of <span class="title">khalif</span>, that is “lieutenant of the Prophet,”
was <span class="person">Abdallah</span>, better known by the name of <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">ابو بِکْر</span>, <span class="trans">Abúbeker</span>,
“Father of the Virgin,” so called because Aíshá, his daughter, was the
only one of Mohammed’s wives who had not been before married to another
man. He was also distinguished by the title of <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">صديق</span> <span class="trans">sadik</span>,
or “the faithful witness,” given to him because he, the first Muselman
after Mohammed’s preaching, attested the miracle of the Prophet’s
ascension to heaven. It was he who collected the verses of the Koran,
which were written upon separate leaves, into one volume, called <span class="title">Almoshaf</span>,
“the book by excellence,” the original text of which was
deposited in the hands of Hafsat, daughter of Omar and widow of
Mohammed. After a reign of two years and three months, he died in
the year 13 of the Hejira, 634 A. D., not without having named his
successor.</p>

<p class="footnote">This was <span class="person">Omar Ben al-Khetab</span>, known under the title of <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">فاروق</span>,
<span class="trans">fárúk´</span>, “the separator,” so called by Mohammed, because he had
separated the head from the body of a Muselman who, not satisfied
with the decision which the Prophet had given in a law-suit, came
to submit the case to Omar’s revision. Under Abubeker’s khalifat, Omar
acted as chief of justice, or chancellor. As khalif he was the first
who took the title of <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">امير ألمومنين</span>, <span class="trans">Emir al-Mu´mením</span>, “prince or
commander of the faithful,” which title devolved to all his successors.
He conquered Syria, Chaldæa, Mesopotamia, Persia, and Egypt, and
built the town of Bassora at the mouth of the Tigris, in order to prevent
the Persians from taking the route to India by the gulph of Persia.
After a reign of ten years he was killed by the hand of a Persian slave,
who, having complained of his master’s cruelty to him, did not receive
the expected redress. Omar, a judge cruel but just, would not fix
the right of succession upon his son, but wishing to keep the khalifat
elective, named six persons, called <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">اهل الشوري</span>, <span class="trans">ahel al-shurah</span>,
“people of council,” who should choose a khalif among themselves.</p>

<p class="footnote">Among these were <span class="person">Osman</span> and <span class="person">Ali</span>. After a hard contest between
these two competitors, the former, supported by his four colleagues, was
proclaimed khalif at the end of the year 23, or the beginning of 24 of the
Hejira, 643 or 644 A. D. Osman Ben Affan was called by his partisans
<span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">ذو النورين</span>, <span class="trans">zo ul naráin</span>, “the possessor of two lights,” because he
had married Rakíah and Omm al Kachúm, both daughters of Mohammed,
whose prophecy was supposed to be the source of light diffused
over his whole posterity. Osman published the Koran such as it was in
the original text, deposited (as was before said) in the hands of Hafsat,
one of Mohammed’s widows, and he caused all copies, differing from
this one, to be suppressed. The domination of the Mohammedans was
established and extended, to the east, in Khorassen and in Upper Asia;
to the west, over the whole northern coast of Africa and even a part
of Spain, during this khalif’s reign, which, after eleven years, terminated
by his violent death in an insurrection which took place against him
in Egypt.</p>

<p class="footnote">The Egyptians offered the government to Ali. As before mentioned,
he was one of the six persons named by Omar as fit for the khalifat,
which Ali claimed as his right, being the cousin-german and son-in-law
(husband of Fatima, the eldest daughter) of Mohammed, and thus the
head of the family of the Hashemites, who were distinguished by the
name of “the house of the Prophet.” After Osman’s death, Ali was by
his party proclaimed the head of the Muselmans. His title was <span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">اسد الله الغالب</span>,
<span class="trans">assad allah al-ghaleb</span>, “the lion of God, the victorious.”
Possessed of great learning, he composed several celebrated works in
prose and in verse, although he had to sustain a continual struggle with
the adverse party. He was assassinated in Kufa, in the year 40 of the
Hejira, 660 A. D. After him, his sons Hassan and Hossain (see note 3,
<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 47-48) fell victims to Moavia, a relation of Osman, and the mortal enemy
of the whole race of Ali. The contest between these two parties was,
after the death of their chiefs, carried on by their numerous adherents,
and, connected as it is with some difference in their religious opinions
and rites, continues to our days. Ali is acknowledged the head of the
شيعة, <span class="trans">Shiâts</span>, which word means in general “a troop, a party,” but is
particularly applied to those who believe that the <span class="title">Imamat</span>, or the supreme
dignity over the Muselmans, belongs by right to Alí and his descendants,
who call themselves <span class="title">Aladiliats</span>, or “the party of the just.” Opposed to
them are the <span class="title">Sonnites</span>, so called from the Arabic word <span class="trans">sonnat</span>, which
signifies “precept, rule,” or the orthodox faith of Muselmans, comprehending
the traditional laws relative to whatever has not been written
by the great legislator (see Herbelot, <span class="decoration">sub voc.</span>).&mdash;<abbr title="Anthony Troyer">A. T.</abbr></p>

 Nushirvan, called by the Arabs <span class="title">Kesra</span>, by the Persians <span class="title">Khosru</span>, is
reckoned by some authors the 19th (by others the 20th) Persian king of
the Sassáníán dynasty, which, according to different opinions, was composed
of 31, 30, or 29 princes, and lasted 527, 500, or 431 years.
Nushirvan reigned from 531 to 579 after J. C. He was called “the
just:” from the outside of his palace to his room was drawn a chain,
by the motion of which he could have notice of any complainant who
wanted redress. He was victorious in the east and west of Asia; he
destroyed the prophet <span class="person">Mazdak</span> (of whom see hereafter, section <abbr title="Fifteen">XV</abbr>); he
brought from India to Persia the fables of <span class="title">Pilpay</span>, called <dfn>Anvarí Sohíli</dfn>,
“the Canopian lights,” and a game similar to chess. During his reign
Mohammed was born. Nushirvan’s favorite minister, <span class="person">Buzerg-Mihr</span>,
called also <span class="person">Buzer-Jmihr</span>, was famous for virtue and wisdom; about
both these personages a great number of marvellous and fabulous accounts

 Ardeshir Babegan was the first king, and founder of the <abbr title="Fourth">IVth</abbr> dynasty
of Persian kings, called the <span class="title">Sasssáníáns</span>, or the <span class="title">Khosroes</span>. His father
was <span class="person">Sassan</span>, a descendant of another <span class="person">Sassan</span>,
the son of <span class="person">Bahman Isfendiar</span>,
the 6th king of the <abbr title="Second">IId</abbr> Persian dynasty, called the <span class="title">Kayánian</span>.
The latter Sassan was reduced to a low station, having become the shepherd
of <span class="person">Babek</span>, a wealthy man, whose daughter he married;&mdash;he had by
her a son named Ardeshir, who took the name of his maternal grandfather
(which is to be noted as an Indian custom): hence he was called
<span class="person">Babegan</span>. He is identified with the Artaxerxes of the Greeks, a contemporary
of the Roman emperor Commodus (A. D. 180-193). The epoch
of his reign is one of the most uncertain points of Persian history. It may
be fixed from the year 200 to 240 of the Christian era.&mdash;<abbr title="Anthony Troyer">A. T.</abbr></p>

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_327" id="footnote_327"></a>

 The 5th Sassan, above mentioned, is said to be the last of fifteen Persian
prophets, the first of whom was Mahábad, and the 13th Zoroaster. The
fifth Sassan lived in the time of Khosru Parviz, who reigned, the 21st or
22nd king of the Sassáníáns, from 591 to 628 of the Christian era. We
read in the Persian preface of the Desatir, that five years after the death of
Khosru Parviz (that is in the year 634), the Persian empire being shaken
by the conquests of the Arabs, the fifth Sassan translated the Desatir. The
English preface of the same work states, that “he died only nine years
before the destruction of the ancient Persian monarchy,” or nine years
before 652, which would be in the year 643 of our era. It appears from
the Desatir (English <abbr title="translation page">transl. p.</abbr> 192), that the fifth Sassan, not less than his
father, the fourth Sassan, was attached to the king Parviz, of whom he
says (ibid. <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 202): “From the wickedness of mankind did it arise that
such an angel-tempered king was taken from the Hirtasis (Persia).”&mdash;<abbr title="Anthony Troyer">A. T.</abbr></p>

 Bahrám Gur (Varanes <abbr title="Five">V</abbr>), the son of Yezdejird <dfn>badkar</dfn> (the iniquitous),
was educated out of Persia. After the death of his father, the
throne having been given to Kisra, a stranger, Bahram came to dispute the
crown, which he proposed should be placed between two famished lions,
and belong to him who should seize it there. Kisra accepted the proposal,
but would not attempt the first to snatch what he already possessed.
Bahram then, after having killed the fierce animals, took and kept the
prize with universal applause. He was the 13th (or 14th) king of the
Sássáníans. After having repulsed an invasion of the Turks, and secured
his empire, he left Persia, and travelled in disguise to India in search of
adventures; by a series of daring actions, he gained a great reputation,
and the hand of an Indian princess, with whom, after two years of absence,
he returned to Persia. Fortunate in war against Greeks and Arabians,
he lost his life in a hunting party, after a reign of 23 (some say
18) years, which is placed from 420 to 438 of our era.&mdash;<abbr title="Anthony Troyer">A. T.</abbr></p>

of a Persian work upon the great conjunctions of the planets, and upon
the events which they produce. This work was translated into Arabic

king of the Péshdadían dynasty (Herbelot). In the book Múgjizat Farsi

 Khosro Parviz was the grandson of Nushirvan, mentioned in our
<a href="#footnote_327">note, page 105</a>, as contemporary of the fifth Sasan, the translator and commentator
of the Desatir. Parviz, soon after having taken possession of
his father’s throne, was driven out of Persia by a fortunate usurper, called
<span class="person">Bahram Ju´bín</span>, and took refuge in the court of the Greek emperor
Mauritius, from whom he obtained not only protection, but also the hand
of his daughter named <span class="person">Mary</span> by some, and by others Shírin, and a powerful
army to recover the kingdom of Persia. According to <span class="person">Eben Batrik</span>
(see <cite>Herbelot</cite>), it was after having been restored to his sovereignty, that
he sued for marriage with the daughter of Mauritius, who answered that
he could not grant his daughter, unless the Persian monarch adopted the
Christian faith. The verses in the text seem to refer to this circumstance,
but express at the same time a strong attachment of Parviz to the ancient
religion of his country, whilst, according to the Arabian author just quoted,
this prince apostatised, in spite of his opposing grandees, for the sake of
the beautiful Shirín, for whom he had conceived an irresistible passion.
Mauritius, his father-in-law, having been put to death, with all his children
except one son, Parviz endeavoured to replace this remaining son
upon the throne of his father. At first successful against Phocas, he was
defeated by Heraclius, the successor of the Greek emperor; he lost all his
conquests, his reputation, his liberty, and at last his life, by a parricide,
his son and successor, Shiruyah or Sirocs.&mdash;<abbr title="Anthony Troyer">A. T.</abbr></p>

SECTION <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr></h3>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">The third section of the Dabistan</span> explains the
laws of the Paímán-i-Farhang (excellent covenant)
and the Hirbed Sár (the pure Highpriest).</p>

<p>The <span class="title">Paiman-i-Farhang</span> is the code of Máhábád,
of which many translations have been made; one of
them is that made by <span class="person">Faridun</span>, the son of <span class="person">Abtin</span>:
another; that of <span class="person">Buzurg-Mihr</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_350" id="fnanchor_350"></a><a href="#footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></span>
for the use of <span class="person">Nushirvan</span>,
the son of <span class="person">Kobad</span>; some extracts from these
have been given in the present work. The <span class="title">Yazdanian</span>,
“godly,” who are also called <dfn>Sahi Kesh</dfn>,
“flourishing faith,” and <dfn>Sipásî</dfn>, “adorers,” maintain
that the most exalted of the prophets, the mightiest
of kings, and the sire of the human race which
exists in this cycle was <span class="title">Máhábád</span>, whom they also
call <dfn>Azar Hushang</dfn>, “the fire of wisdom.” They
also say that it is thus recorded in the code of this
venerable personage, which is the word of God;
and that moreover, this mighty prince has himself
expressly announced that the Divine Essence, which
has no equal, is totally devoid and divested of all
form and figure; incapable of being the object of
<a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 148</span>
conception or similitude: also that the tropes of the
most eloquent orators, the illustrations of the most
enlightened and profound geniuses, are utterly
unable to convey a clear idea of the light, which
has neither perceptible color nor sign: the sublime
speculations of the learned and the discriminating
understandings of the sage are too feeble to comprehend
the substance of the pure essence of that light,
which is without equal, quality, color, or model:
also that all existences have proceeded from the
bounty and wisdom of the Almighty, and are consequently
his creation: that not a single atom in this
world, nor even the motion of a hair on the body of
a living creature escapes his knowledge: all which
propositions are proved by evident demonstrations
deduced from various premises, and accompanied
by excellent commentaries, the enumeration of which
this abridged treatise cannot admit. Also that the
cognizance of the self-existent God extends alike to
the most minute particles of matter and the entire
universe.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Description of the great Angels of the first
order.</span>&mdash;In the code of the great apostle Máhábád it
is thus stated; the work of God is above the power
of the tongue, and infinitely exceeds the calculations
to which the inhabitants of this lower elemental
world have recourse: the operations of the Eternal
are from eternity to eternity: they assign the name
<a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 149</span>
of <span class="title">Bahman</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_351" id="fnanchor_351"></a><a href="#footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></span>
to the first Angel whom the Almighty
invested with the mantle of existence, and through
the medium of whom it was communicated to others.
The planets, fixed stars, and heavens have each their
peculiar conservative Angel; also the four elements
below the lunar sphere have four conservative
Angels, and in like manner all productions connected
with them: for example, in minerals there are many
precious stones, such as rubies, sapphires, and emeralds
of every kind, which are under the dominion
of their good, munificent, protecting Angel: and so
on with respect to all species of vegetable and animal
productions. The name given to the conservative
angel of mankind is <span class="title">Farun Faro
Vakhshúr</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_352" id="fnanchor_352"></a><a href="#footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 150</span>
<span class="sc">Description of the second order of Angels.</span>&mdash;The
code of Máhábád states that the second rank is assigned
to the Angels connected with bodies: that
is, every heaven and every star has a simple uncompounded
spirit, bare of matter, as it is neither a
body nor material: also that all living beings in the
world have an uncompounded soul.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Description of the third order of Angels.</span>&mdash;It is
stated in the code of Máhábád, that angelic beings of
the third rank are the same as the superior and
inferior bodies. The superior bodies are those of
the sphere and the stars; and the inferior the four
(<span class="title">guhar</span>) elements. The most noble of all bodies are
those of the sphere.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Description of the gradations of Paradise.</span>&mdash;The
code of Máhábád states thus: “In the <dfn>Mînú</dfn> or
‘azure heaven’ there are many gradations, we
shall first enumerate the gradations of Paradise
in this lower world. The first gradation consists
of minerals, such as rubies, sapphires, emeralds,
and the like; the second of vegetation, such as
plane trees, cypress, gardens, etc.; the third of
animals, such as the Arab horse, the camel, and
such like; the fourth consisting of selected individuals
amongst men, such as princes and those
connected with that class, persons in the enjoyment
<a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 151</span>
of health, the contented, and such like; all
which gradations they call <dfn>Mînú Sár</dfn>, ‘celestial
abode,’ and <dfn>Bîst Lád</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_353" id="fnanchor_353"></a><a href="#footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></span>
that is, <dfn>Feróden feró</dfn>, ‘the
low foundation.’” In these states there is a
retrospect; for example, there is one man who in
relation to his deeds gradually descends to the animal
state; whilst the terrene particles of virtuous
men’s bodies change either to the vegetable state or
that of the choicest minerals, however without the
existence of an incorporeal soul in either of them.
On ascending from this state, the change is called
<dfn>Lim Sar</dfn>, or “dwelling on high;” the first is the
lunar step; for in the soul of the exalted moon are
the forms of all those beings into which the elements
enter. A person on arriving there remains in it,
becoming the regent of all the lower world, and in
proportion to his knowledge and the habits resulting
from his laudable qualities, assumes a better form.
On arriving at a higher rank than this, he finds augmented
delight as far as the solar step; for the sun
is the <dfn>Pirah-i-Yazdan</dfn>, or “the ornament of God,”
that is, the viceroy of the Lord and sovereign of the
stars, whose gracious influence pervades both high
and low. On leaving this and passing through the
various gradations to the empyreal heaven, every
step becomes more delightful and excellent. On
<a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 152</span>
ascending beyond the great sphere, he arrives at the
curtain<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_354" id="fnanchor_354"></a><a href="#footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></span>
of the great Angels and contemplates the
Lord of the light of lights surrounded by angels: no
state can surpass the beatitude and glory of this
gradation, which is called the <dfn>Mînúiván Mînú</dfn>, or
“heaven of heavens.”</p>

<p><span class="sc">Description of the infernal regions.</span>&mdash;The code
of Máhábád states thus: Hell is situated under the
sphere of <em>the moon</em>:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_355" id="fnanchor_355"></a><a href="#footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></span>
the first step consisting of
minerals in mis-shapen masses, or stones without
worth; of plants, thorny and vile and poisonous
herbage; of living creatures, such as ants, serpents,
and scorpions; and of men labouring under indigence,
sickness, feebleness, ignorance, and disgrace:
in this step man is punished for whatever evil actions
he has committed, and escapes not without due retribution.
However, the severest gradation of the infernal
regions is that of mental anguish, which is appropriated
to the irreligious philosophers, for when
his elemental body is dissolved, they do not assign
him another; so that he finds not his way to heaven,
but remains in the lower elemental world, consumed
by the flames of anguish: besides, in consequence
of his detestable qualities, his tormentors pounce
<a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 153</span>
upon him in the shape of serpents, scorpions, and
other such plagues. This state they denominate
<dfn>Puchán-i-Púch</dfn>, or “the hell of hells.”</p>

<p>The code of Máhábád also states, that whatever
occurs in this elemental world proceeds entirely
from the planets; so that their adoration, next to
that of the Almighty, becomes an indispensable
duty: for these luminaries approach near the palace
of the Almighty, and the chiefs of the court of eternity.
In this world, whoever draws near the seat
of grandeur, must have a friend to sound his praise,
which is a measure much to be commended. The
person who undertakes a journey cannot do without
a guide, and he who goes to a city where he has no
friend, meets with difficulty: consequently, the worship
tendered to these dignities is much to be commended.
The stars are truly many in number,
but amidst these multitudes, the influences of the
seven planets are the most evident: also of all the
starry hosts the sun is the sovereign lord. It is
therefore necessary to form seven images, and to
raise that of the sun above the others; the temples
built by the Abadîán princes were open on all sides,
so that when the sun shone they were exceedingly
bright in the interior; not like the Hindoo idol-temples,
in which they walk about with lamps, even in
the day time: the roofs of the Abadîán temples were
also rather elevated. The emperors and princes are
<a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 154</span>
individuals of the most select description, on which
account the king should find repose in the fourth
sphere, which is one of the solar regions. As it is
evident that the stars are set by God for the due government
of the world, in like manner it is clear that
it is not every individual indiscriminately who attains
to the regal dignity, but only a royal personage,
not opposed to the <dfn>Farhang-Abád</dfn>, or the law of <span class="title">Azar
Húshang</span>: as otherwise he would be undeserving of
the supreme power. Of the qualifications indispensably
requisite in a monarch, the first is conformity
to the faith above described, and firmness in adhering
to it. In the next place, if on the side of both
parents, which means <dfn>Hasab va Nasab</dfn>, “accomplishments
and genealogy,” he were of royal descent,
it would be more advantageous: the meaning of royal
birth is to be the possessor of the kingdom of justice;
if every external qualification be united with the
supreme power, it is much more agreeable, so that
the king should not say, “I am more excellent than
my father, and he than his ancestors:” on the
contrary, he styles his father “highly distinguished,”
and his grandfather “far superior.” Moreover, if
any one should praise him on this account, he should
order that person to be chastised. <span class="person">Azizi</span>, “a distinguished
man,”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_356" id="fnanchor_356"></a><a href="#footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></span>
has said: “The following is what
<a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 155</span>
we mean by this principle; that as one sire is
superior to another, if a son should imagine himself
the greater, then each child would reckon
himself superior to his father, and there would
then be no acknowledged ruler.”</p>

<p>A king must also be provided with a distinguished
mathematician as prime minister, to whom
the calculators and astronomers should be subject;
in every city there should be an astronomer
or surveyor; and an
<dfn>Arshiya</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_357" id="fnanchor_357"></a><a href="#footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a></span>
or accountant, should
act as vizir, one well versed in the amount of rents
paid by the Rayas; he must also have commissaries;
and as there are attached to every city many
villages and hamlets, the king’s private property,
to which the local director attends, that officer is
called the <span class="title">Vizhak</span>. Also with every vizir, whether
absent or present, there should be two <dfn>Ustuwars</dfn> or
supervisors, and two <dfn>Shudahbands</dfn>, or recorders of
occurrences; the same rule is to be observed with
all administrators, and the <dfn>Samán Sálár</dfn>, or head
steward, the chief reporters and inspectors should
also be each accompanied by two Ustuwars and
two Shudahbands. <dfn>Dustoor</dfn>, or prime minister,
means the person to whose department the public
revenue is attached: the copies of the registers of
all the vizirs should be regularly kept at the seat
<a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 156</span>
of government, as well as the papers of the Shudahbands.</p>

<p>The king also requires military commanders, in
order that they may keep the soldiers in due discipline.
The first dignity consists of the chiefs of a
hundred thousand cavalry; the second, of the commanders
of thousands; the third, of the commanders
of hundreds; the fourth, of the rulers over tens;
and the fifth, of those accompanied by two, three,
four, or five persons. Thus in this assemblage every
ten persons have an officer and every hundred a
Sipahdar, called in the popular language of Hindustan
<span class="trans">Bakhshi</span>, “pay-master,” in that of Iran, <span class="trans">Lashkar
Navîs</span>, or “army-registrar,” and in Arabic, <span class="trans">Ariz</span>,
or “notary:” a similar arrangement must be observed
in the infantry. In like manner, when the
military in regular succession are in attendance on
the king, there is at court a <dfn>Bárnîgárî</dfn>, or “registrar,”
to set down those who are absent as well
as those present; in the popular language of India
this officer is styled <dfn>Chauki Navîs</dfn>, or “register
keeper;” they are accompanied by a <dfn>Shudahband</dfn>,
an <dfn>Ustuwar</dfn>, and sentinels, so that they may not go
to their homes nor give way to sleep until their
period of duty is terminated: there are also different
sentinels for day and night. It is also so arranged
that there should be always four persons together
on each watch, two of whom may indulge in sleep
<a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 157</span>
whilst the other two remain awake. In every city
where the king is present there ought to be a <span class="title">Shudahband</span>,
to report to the king whatever occurs in
the city: the same rule should be observed in the
other cities also: this functionary they call, in India,
<dfn>Wakia-Navis</dfn>, “news-writer.” There should also
be a <dfn>Shahnah</dfn>, or “intendant of police,” styled <dfn>Farhang-i-roz</dfn>,
“registrar of the day,” who is to conduct
all affairs with due prudence, and not suffer
people to inflict injury on each other. He is to have
two <span class="title">Shudahbands</span> and an <dfn>Ustuwar</dfn> or “confidential
secretary.” In like manner, among the troops of
the great nobles there must be two <span class="title">Shudahbands</span>;
and in all provinces a <dfn>Shahrdar</dfn>, or governor; and
in every city a <dfn>Bud-andoz</dfn>, or collector-general, a
<dfn>Sipah-dar</dfn>, that is a Bakhshi, and an intendant of
police, or <dfn>Shahnah</dfn>; it is to be noted that among the
Yezdánían, a <span class="title">Kázî</span> and <span class="title">Shuhnah</span>
were the same, as the
people practised no oppression towards each other.
The <span class="title">Shudahband</span>, the <span class="title">Návand</span>
(writer), and the <span class="title">Rávand</span>
(courier), or those who conveyed intelligence to
the king, had many spies set over them secretly by
his majesty, and all those officers wrote him an
account of whatever occurred in the city. If the
<span class="title">Sipahdars</span> did not give the men their just dues,
these officers called them to account: also if a
superior noble acted in a similar manner towards
his inferiors, they instituted an inquiry into his
<a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 158</span>
conduct: they also took note of the spies; so
that if any secret agent made himself known as
such, he was immediately dismissed. If any one
kept the due of the soldier or of the cultivator, in
the name of the king, and did not account for it,
they inflicted chastisement on him. The officers
were obliged to delineate the features of every one
employed in the cavalry or infantry, and also to furnish
a representation of his horse, and to give the
men their regular pay with punctuality. Previous
to the Gilsháhian dynasty, no one ever branded the
king’s horses, as this was regarded as an act of
cruelty towards the animal: most of the soldiers
also were furnished with horses by the king, as the
sovereigns of Ajem had many studs. On the death
of a horse, the testimony of the collectors and inspectors
was requisite. Every soldier who received not
a horse from the king, brought his own with him:
they also took one out of twenty from the Rayas.
However, under the Sassanian princes, the Rayas
requested “to take from them one out of ten:” and
as this proposition was accepted, it was therefore
called <dfn>Baj-i-hamdastani</dfn>, or voluntary contribution,
as having been settled by the consent of the Rayas.</p>

<p>The Omras and the great of the kingdom, near
and far, had not the power to put a guilty man to
death; but when the <dfn>Shadahband</dfn>, “recorder,”
brought a case before the king, his majesty acted
<a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 159</span>
according to the prescriptions of the <span class="title">Ferhang-abad</span>,
unless in the case of executing a dangerous rebel,
when, from sparing him until receiving the king’s
will, a great evil would arise to the country.</p>

<p>They laid down this royal ordinance: that if the
king sent even a single person, he was to bring back
the head of the commander of a hundred thousand;
nay, that person never turned aside from the punishment.
For example, when such a commander
in the time of Shah <span class="person">Máhbúl</span> had put an innocent man
to death, the prince sent a person who was to behead
the criminal on a day on which the nobles were
all assembled: and of this there are innumerable
examples. Also in the time of Shah <span class="person">Faridún</span>, the
son of <span class="person">Abtin</span>, the son of <span class="person">Farshad</span>,
the son of <span class="person">Shá-î
Gilîv</span>, a general named <span class="person">Máhlád</span> was governor of
<span class="place">Khorosan</span>: and he having put to death one of the
village chiefs, the Shudahbands reported to the king
all the public and private details of the fact, on
receiving which the king thus wrote to Máhlád:
“Thou hast acted contrary to the Farhang Abad.”
When Mahlád had perused the king’s letter, he
assembled the chief men of the province, and sending
for the village chieftain’s son, put a sword in his
hand that he might cut off his head: the son replied:
“I consent to pass over my father’s blood.”
Máhlád, however, would not agree to this, and insisted
so earnestly, that the young man cut off his
<a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 160</span>
head, which was sent to the court. The king greatly
commended this conduct, and according to his usual
practice conferred Máhlád’s office on his son. In
the same manner, the Moghúls submitted implicitly
to the commands of the Lord strengthened by the
Almighty, that is, to <span class="person">Jenghiz
Khan</span>;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_358" id="fnanchor_358"></a><a href="#footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a></span>
and the tribes
of <span class="place">Kazl-Básh</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_359" id="fnanchor_359"></a><a href="#footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></span>
were equally obedient to <span class="person">Ismail Safavi</span>
during his reign. But the kings of Ajem were averse
to the infliction of capital punishments, so that until
a criminal had been declared deserving of death,
according to the Abádían code, the order for his
execution was not issued.</p>

<p>The kings and chieftains of Iran never addressed
harsh language to any one; but whenever a person
deserved chastisement or death, they summoned the
<dfn>Farhangdar</dfn>, or “judge,” and the <dfn>Dad-sitani</dfn>, or
“mufti;” on which, whatever the code of <span class="title">Farhang-abad</span>
enjoined in the case, whether beating with
rods or confinement, was carried into effect: but
the beating and imprisonment were never executed
<a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 161</span>
by low persons. Whatever intelligence was communicated
by spies was submitted to a careful examination,
in which they took great pains; and that
unless reports made by two or more spies coincided,
they carried nothing into execution. The princes
and young nobles, like all others, began by personal
attendance on the king: for example, the routine of
<dfn>Hash-o-bash</dfn>, or “presence and absence” at court,
was enjoined them in rotation, that they might better
understand the state of humbler individuals: they
even attended on foot, that they might more easily
conceive the toils of the foot-soldier.</p>

<p><span class="person">Bahzad</span> the Yasanian, in one of his marches having
proceeded a short distance, alighted from his
horse,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_360" id="fnanchor_360"></a><a href="#footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></span>
on which a distinguished noble, named <span class="person">Naubar</span>, thus
remarked: “On a march it is not proper to remain
satisfied with so short a journey.” On this, <span class="person">Bahzad</span>
Shah, leaving the army in that place, said to the
commander <span class="person">Naubar</span>, “Let us two make a short
excursion.” He himself mounted on horseback,
and obliged the other to advance on foot. They
thus traversed mountain and plain, until <span class="person">Naubar</span>
became overpowered by fatigue, on which <span class="person">Bahzad</span>
said: “Exert thyself, for our halting place is near;”
but he having replied, “I am no longer able to
move,” the king rejoined; “O oppressor! as
<a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 162</span>
thou art no longer able to proceed, dost thou not
perceive that those who are on foot experience
similar distress from performing too long a
march?”</p>

<p>The military, in proportion to their respective
ranks, had assigned to them costly dresses, vigorous
steeds with trappings and saddles inlaid with precious
stones, equipments, some of solid gold and silver,
and others plated with gold or silver, and helmets.
The distinguished men were equally remote
from parsimony and profuseness. The nobles of
Ajem wore a crown worth a hundred thousand
dinars of gold: the regal diadem being appropriated
to the king. All the great Amirs wore helmets and
zones of gold; they also had trappings and sandals
of the same. When the soldiers set out on an expedition,
they took with them arms of every description,
a flag and a poignard;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_361" id="fnanchor_361"></a><a href="#footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></span>
they were habituated
to privations, and entered on long expeditions with
scanty supplies: they were never confined within
the enclosure of tents and pavilions, but braved alike
the extremes of heat and cold. In the day of battle,
as long as the king or his lieutenant stood at his
post, if any one turned his back on the foe, no person
<a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 163</span>
would join him in eating or drinking, or contract
alliance with him, except those who like himself
had consigned their persons to infamy and
degradation. Lunatics, buffoons, and depraved characters
found no access to the king or chieftains.</p>

<p>On the death of a person who had been raised to
dignity, his post was conferred on his son, or some
one of his legitimate connections adequate to its duties;
thus no innocent person was ever deprived of
office, so that their noble families continued from
the time of <span class="person">Sháî Kilîv</span> to that of
<span class="person">Sháî Mahbul</span>. When
king <span class="person">Khusró</span>, the son of
<span class="person">Faridún</span>, the son of <span class="person">Abtin</span>,
the son of <span class="person">Forzad</span>, the son of
<span class="person">Shái Kiliv</span>, had sent
<span class="person">Gurgin</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_362" id="fnanchor_362"></a><a href="#footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a></span>
the son of <span class="person">Lás</span> to a certain post, that dignity
remained in his family more than a thousand
years; and when, in the reign of the resplendent
sovereign, king <span class="person">Ardeshir</span>, <span class="person">Madhur</span> the descendant of
Gurgin had become a lunatic, the king confined him
to his house, and promoted his son <span class="person">Mábzád</span> to the
government; and similar to this was the system of
Shah <span class="person">Ismail Safavi</span>. But if an Amir’s son were
unfit for governing, he was dismissed from office,
and had a suitable pension assigned him. Nay, animals,
<a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 164</span>
such as the cow, ass, and horse, which were
made to labor when young, were maintained by
their masters in a state of ease when they grew old;
the quantity of burden which each animal was to
carry was defined, and whoever exceeded that limit
received due chastisement. In like manner, when any
of the infantry or cavalry grew feeble, infirm, or old,
although he might not have performed effective service,
they appointed his son to succeed him; and if
the latter was not yet of mature age, they settled on
him a daily allowance from the royal treasury. But
if he had no son, they assigned him during his life
such an allowance as would keep him from distress,
which allowance was continued after his decease
to his wife, daughter, or other survivors.
Whatever constitutes the duty of a parent was all
performed by the king; if, in the day of battle, a
soldier’s horse fell, they bestowed on him a better
and finer one. It has already been said that most
of the cavalry horses were supplied by the king,
and the military were at no expense save that of
forage. If a soldier fell in battle, they appointed the
son with great distinction to his father’s post, and
also conferred many favors on his surviving family;
they also greatly exerted themselves in teaching
them the duties of their class, and in guarding their
domestic honor inviolate: as, in reality, the king is
the father, and the kingdom the common mother.
<a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 165</span>
In like manner, when a soldier was wounded, he
received the greatest attentions. Similar notice was
taken of workers in gold and of merchants who had
failed and become impoverished, their children being
adopted by the government: so that, within the
circuit of their dominions, there was not found a
single destitute person. The Sardár of each city
took cognizance of every stranger who entered it:
in the same way, all friendless travellers were received
into the royal hospital, where physicians gave
themselves up to the curing of the sick: in these
there were also Shudahbands to take care that none
of those employed should be backward in their respective
offices. The blind, the paralytic, the feeble,
and destitute were admitted into the royal hospital,
where they passed their time free from anxiety.
Now the royal <span class="title">Bîmárastán</span>, or hospital was a place
in which they gave a daily allowance to the feeble
and indigent: thus there were no religious mendicants
or beggars in their dominions; whoever wished,
embraced a Durvesh’s life and practised religious
austerities in a monastery, a place adapted for every
description of pious mortifications: a slothful person,
or one of ill repute, was not permitted to become
a Durvesh, lest he might do it for the purpose of
indulging in food and sleep: to such a character
they enjoined the religious exercises suitable to a
Durvesh, which, if he performed with zeal, it was
<a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 166</span>
all well; but, otherwise, he was obliged to follow
his inclinations in some other place.</p>

<p>The king had also confidential courtiers, well
skilled in the histories of the righteous men of olden
time, which they recited to his majesty. There was
also an abundance of astrologers and physicians, so
that, both in the capital and in the provinces, one of
each, agreeably to the royal order, should attend on
every governor; and their number was such in every
city, that men might consult them on the favorable
and unfavorable moments for every undertaking.</p>

<p>In every city was a royal hospital, in which were
stationed physicians appointed by the king; there
were separate hospitals for women, where they were
attended by skilful female physicians, so that the
hospitals for men and women were quite distinct.
In addition to all this, the king stands in need of
wise <dfn>Farhangs</dfn>, “judges,” well versed in the decisions
of law and the articles of faith, so that, aided
by the royal influence and power, they may restrain
men from evil deeds, and deliver the institutes of
Farhang, “the true faith,” to
them.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_363" id="fnanchor_363"></a><a href="#footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></span>
The king
also requires writers to be always in his presence.
<a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 167</span>
A great Mobed must be acquainted with all sciences;
a confidential courtier, conversant with the narratives
and histories of kings; a physician, profound in
medical science; an astrologer in his calculations of
the stars; an accountant, accurate in his accounts;
and a <dfn>Farhangí</dfn>, or lawyer, well versed in points of
law: moreover, the study of that portion of the
code contained in the <span class="title">Páiman-i-Farhang</span>, or in the
“covenant of the Farhang,” is incumbent on all,
both soldiers, Rayas, and those who practise the mechanic
arts, and on other people. In like manner,
persons of one rank were not wont to intermeddle
with the pursuits of another: for example, that a
soldier should engage in commerce, or a merchant
in the military profession: on the contrary, the two
employments should not be confounded, so that one
should at the same time be a military man and a
servant, or in any employment; and having become
a commander, should again take up the trade.</p>

<p>They also permitted in every city such a number
of artificers, conductors of amusements, merchants,
and soldiers as was strictly necessary; to the remainder,
or surplus, they assigned agricultural occupations;
so that, although many people may know
these arts, yet no more than is required may be occupied
with them, but apply themselves wholly to the
cultivation of the soil. If any officer made even a
trifling addition to the import on any business which
<a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 168</span>
brought in a revenue to the king, so far from its
being acceptable, they, on the contrary, ordered that
ill-disposed person to be severely punished.</p>

<p>The king gave audience every day: but on one
day of the week in particular, he acted as <dfn>Dádsitán</dfn>,
or “Mufti,” when every person who was wronged
had access to the sovereign; also, once a year, he
gave a general audience, when everyone who pleased
came into his presence; on this occasion, the king
sat down at table with the Ráyás, who represented
to him, without the intervention of another, whatever
they thought proper.</p>

<p>The sovereign had two places of audience; one
the <dfn>Rózistán</dfn>, or “day-station,” in which he was
seated on an elevated seat; which place they also
called the <dfn>Tábsár</dfn>, or “place of splendor;” around
which the nobles and champions stood in their
respective ranks; the other was the <dfn>Shabistán</dfn>, or
“night station,” which had also an elevation, on
which the king took his seat. Men of distinction
stood on the outside; those of royal dignity were at
the door; and next the king was a company standing
with weapons of war in their hands. Every one,
indiscriminately, had not the privilege of laying his
hand on the royal feet; some only kissed the slipper
and walked around it; others, the sleeve of the royal
mantle which fell on the throne: that person must
be in high favor at court who was permitted to kiss
<a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 169</span>
the king’s feet, or the throne, or perform a circuit
around it.</p>

<p>As a brief account has been given of the exterior
place of reception, and of the <dfn>Rózistán</dfn>, or “day
station,” we now proceed to write a few particulars
concerning the interior place of reception, or
the secret night station, or the <dfn>Harem</dfn>, which is also
called the “golden musk-perfumed pavilion.” In
the code of <span class="title">Azar Húshang</span>,
or <span class="title">Máhábád</span>, it has been
thus laid down: whatever be the number of the
king’s women, there must be one superior in dignity
to all the rest: her they style “the Great Lady;”
but she possessed not such absolute power that the
right of loosing or binding, inflicting the bastinado,
or putting to death within the night station should
be conferred on her: or that she could put to death
whomsoever she pleased without the king’s consent,
a power quite opposed to law.</p>

<p>The <span class="title">Shudahbands</span> also report to the royal presence
all the transactions of the Great Princess and of the
night station, just as they transmit accounts of those
persons who live out of its precincts. If the king’s
mother be alive, the supremacy is of course vested
in her, and not in the Great Princess. <dfn>Salárbárs</dfn>,
or “ushers with silver maces,” <dfn>Jádárs</dfn>, or “superintendants
of police,” <dfn>Gáhnumás</dfn> or <dfn>Shudahbands</dfn>,
astrologers and such like professions, were also
met with in the interior residence.</p>

<p><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 170</span>
Of these women and princesses not one had the
smallest degree of authority over the rest of their
sex who lived outside of the precincts, nor did they
possess the power of issuing any order whatever; nay
they seldom made mention of them in the royal <span class="title">Rozistan</span>;
neither were they called by any fixed title; nor,
without urgent necessity, did they ride out in public.</p>

<p>The king also, on visiting the interior apartment,
is not wont to remain long with the women; nor
do they ever entertain any wishes which have not
reference to themselves; such as the mode of speaking
when enjoining an officer to perform some service,
or increasing the dignity of the great warriors.
The same system was followed by every Amir in his
own house; but in the dwelling of every Amir, whether
near or remote, there was an aged matron or
<dfn>Atuni</dfn>, deputed on the king’s part, with the office of
Shudahband, to report the exact state of affairs to
the Great Princess, or to send from a distance a
written report for being brought before the king.</p>

<p>To the king’s Harem, or to that of an Amir, no
males had access, except boys not come to maturity,
or eunuchs; but criminals only were qualified
for the latter class, who were never after admitted
to any confidential intimacy; and no individual in
their empire was allowed from motives of gain to
have recourse to that operation.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_364" id="fnanchor_364"></a><a href="#footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 171</span>
Every year, on certain occasions, on some great
festivals, the wives of the Amirs waited on the Great
Princess, and the women of the city came to the
general levee; but the king never saw these women,
as on such days he did not enter the musk-perfumed
pavilion, but departed to some other place, so that
his eyes might not fall on a strange female. The
motives of the ladies’ visit to the king was this:
that if any were oppressed by their husbands, it
might be reported to the king, who after proper
investigation was to enjoin the punishment awarded
by the court of justice.</p>

<p>The great king partook not of reason-subduing
strong drinks, as he was a guardian, and as
such should not be in a state of helplessness; on
which account not one of those kings who were
styled guardians ever polluted his lips with wine or
other intoxicating beverage before the Gilshaiyan
dynasty. The cup-bearers of the king’s sons and
other nobles were always females, and these were
<a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 172</span>
called <dfn>Bádeks</dfn>:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_365" id="fnanchor_365"></a><a href="#footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></span>
no beardless males were admitted
to the feast: even eunuchs were excluded from the
banquets of the Gilshaiyan princes, and they were
waited on by beardless youths under ten years of
age; and at the time of taking wine even they were
not allowed to be present. The ancients, or those
previous to the Gilshaiyan dynasty, had appointed
seasons for drinking wine, which occurred when
the physicians prescribed it for the removal of some
infirmity, on which occasions they conformed to the
above-mentioned rules. If any one, and the king in
particular, labored under a malady the cure of which
could only be effected by wine, and the invalid
should be altogether reluctant to the drinking of it,
in that case, as the cure was confined to the use of
wine, the patient was obliged to comply with the
prescription: for things forbidden under other circumstances,
become lawful when taken for medicinal
purposes: but with this reservation, that no
injury should accrue to any innoxious animal.</p>

<p>Along the roads frequented by travellers in this
realm, there were many caravansaries, between
every two of which were posted sentinels, so that
the voice of a person reached from one to the next.
In every halting-place was a <dfn>Shudahband</dfn>, a physician,
and a <dfn>Tîmárî</dfn>; and the inns were also constructed
<a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 173</span>
near each other. Now a <span class="title">Tîmárî</span> is one appointed
by the king to protect the helpless, such as persons
of tender years and the infirm. Aged women brought
out from the Haram all the requisite supplies (for
these establishments), which they transferred to
aged men, by whom they were conveyed to the
attendants.</p>

<p>The soldiers’ wives were not without employment,
such as spinning, sewing, and in various
works, the making of house-furniture, riding, and
in the management of the bow they were as able as
men; they were all formed by discipline and inured
to toil.</p>

<p>It is evident to all the world that, notwithstanding
the extent of their realms was so exceedingly great
and spacious, yet in consequence of these arrangements,
the kings were necessarily informed of every
event which occurred: in addition to what has been
stated, pursuant to decrees influential as those of
Heaven, villages were erected at every stage and
halting-place, at each of which the king’s horses
were picketted, and men appointed whom they called
<dfn>Ravand</dfn>, or “couriers.” When the <span class="title">Shudahband</span> day
by day delivered the report of whatever had occurred
into the hand of a courier, the one near the
city delivered it into the custody of another, and so
on, from the couriers of the stage to those of the
villages, until the report reached the capital. The
<a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 174</span>
king observed the same system in corresponding
with the Umras; at one time appointing an individual
who was with great caution to communicate
the royal despatches without entrusting them into
the hands of another; a courier of this description
mounted at every stage the king’s post-horses which
were picketted at the different halting-places until
he completed his object: this description of courier
they call <dfn>Nuwand</dfn>; the Umras also despatched <span class="title">Nuwands</span>
to the king’s court; but the couriers belonging
to royalty or the nobility were not empowered to
seize any individual’s horse, or practise oppression,
as they would in that case meet with due retaliation:
there were besides, at the different villages, persons
stationed as guards, who were liable to be called to
account if a traveller suffered oppressive treatment
from any quarter. <span class="title">Shadahbands</span> also were there.
<span class="person">Azar Húsháng</span>, that is, <span class="title">Máhábád</span>, thus enjoined:
“Let there be no exactions practised towards the
Rayas: let him afford what he well can, and nothing
more;” they therefore only took such an
amount as maintained both soldiers and rayas in
tranquillity.</p>

<p>All the king’s devoted servants entertained this
belief, that the performance of whatever was agreeable
to the king was attended with advantage in both
worlds; also that the royal command was the interpretation
of the word of God, and that it was highly
<a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 175</span>
praiseworthy to meet death in the path of obedience
to the Great King: nay, they accounted death, with
the prospect of royal approbation, which is the bestower
of paradise, as far superior to life; but he
must be a king who acts in conformity with the
<dfn>Paiman-i-Farhang</dfn>, or “excellent code.” In short,
the system of inquiry was such, that the inspectors
used to question the soldiers, whether they were
satisfied or not with their chief.</p>

<p>With respect to keeping guard, it was thus settled;
that out of the four persons acting in concert
with each other, two went to sleep and the other
two stood up armed; again, when the sleepers arose
the others went to rest; and on the expiration of
the night, other troops came to keep watch: the
night sentinels, however, did not depart but by
order of their officer. These inspected the men
three times during the night. In that manner each
person had, every week, one day’s watch: and
when they retired from keeping guard, proclamation
was made to this purport by the king’s command:
“If any have cause of complaint against their inspector
or chief, let them not keep it concealed.”</p>

<p>In like manner every month the inspectors, whether
near or remote, looked into the state of the
military; if they found any individual, without sufficient
cause, deficient in the requisites for service,
they ordered him to be punished, unless he adduced
<a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 176</span>
a satisfactory excuse and testimony; in which case
they accepted his reasons: and if they proceeded
from overpowering necessity, they had regard
to it.</p>

<p>To whomsover they had assigned land, <span class="title">Jaghir</span> or
<span class="title">Mukásá</span>, they gave daily or monthly pay with the
greatest punctuality, never permitting any deficiency
to occur.</p>

<p>If any were deficient in the performance of duty,
for example, being absent one watch without sufficient
cause, besides inflicting the due punishment,
they deducted the pay of that watch, but not of the
whole day. When, for some good reason, he applied
for a furlough, he obtained it.</p>

<p>The prime minister was obliged to institute an
inquiry into any affair of which he got the necessary
information. The <dfn>Rais sufid</dfn>, “chieftain,” must
produce a Khushnúdí namah, or “a certificate,”
purporting that he had given the due to his people,
and that they were satisfied with him; also that
whatever revenue had been received was delivered
over to the inspector, in the presence of the Anim
and Shudahband: the inspectors also produced, in
the royal presence, certificates stating that they had
practised no oppression towards the military: and
although the spies made a report of all particulars
every week, still the king inquired besides of the
soldiers, as to the truth of this approbation.</p>

<p><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 177</span>
The Yazdaníans never attempted a thing mentioned
with abhorrence in the Farhang code, in which
every fault had its fixed punishment. When any
one was convicted of a crime, the king’s near attendants
never made intercession for him: for example,
pursuant to this code, and by the king’s command,
the son inflicted punishment on the father, and the
father on his son, so that even princes of the blood
had not the power of breaking this law; if they were
guilty of injustice, the kings themselves inflicted the
allotted punishment: for example, <span class="person">Jai Alád</span> had a
son called <span class="person">Húdah</span>, whom he himself beheaded for
having put to death the son of a villager. The king’s
devoted servants raised themselves to distinction by
their excellence and exertions to obtain praise and
titles: whoever swore falsely by the royal family
was expelled from all intercourse with them.</p>

<p>There were peculiar places assigned for the combat
of elephants, lions, and other wild beasts, the
backs and sides of which places were so elevated, that
people might behold from every part, without the
possibility of sustaining injury from the elephants
and other wild animals: the king being all the while
seated on a lofty throne. They never created embarrassments
in bazars or populous places with furious
elephants or fierce lions, but kept them in remote
situations and secure places such as before-mentioned,
from whence they could easily remove them.
<a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 178</span>
It is recorded that, in the time of Shírzád Shah, the
Yassánian, an elephant having broken out of the
place where he was tied up, killed some one; on
which the king, in retaliation for the deed, put the
elephant to death, and also inflicted capital punishment
on the elephant-keepers and the door-keepers
of the elephant-stables, who had left the door open.
The king never listened to tales of fiction, but solely
to true statements: the military and the rayas also
never averted their necks from executing the king’s
commands: and if a traveller invoked the king’s
name and entered into any house, the inmates not
only washed his feet, but even drank the water in
which they performed the operation, as a sovereign
remedy, and sedulously showed all due attentions to
their guest.</p>

<p>On the day of battle, the soldiers were drawn up
in right, centre, and left columns, an arrangement
which they never violated in any engagement: as
when once dissolved, the restoration of that combined
order would be impossible: when the troops
had been arrayed in this manner, they gave the
enemy battle; and in proportion to the necessity,
the bazar, or “market” of assistance followed
them: even after victory they observed the same
arrangement.</p>

<p>On the day of triumph, when the enemy fled and
the foe dispersed, the entire army did not give themselves
<a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 179</span>
up to plunder; but the king appointed for the
service a certain detachment, accompanied by <dfn>Shudahbands</dfn>
and <dfn>Binandahs</dfn>, or inspectors and supervisors,
whilst the rest of the army remained prepared
for battle and ready to renew the engagement;
not one of them raising the dust of plunder or departing
to their homes, lest the enemy, on discovering
their dispersion in pursuit of plunder, might
return and gain the victory. When they had made
themselves masters of the spoil, the king ordered
them to set apart the choicest portion for the indigent
and the erection of religious foundations: he
next distributed an ample share to the men proportioned
to their exertions; after which he gave each
of his courtiers a portion; and he lastly conferred a
suitable portion on the great officers; but no part of
this division entered into the account of the allowances
settled on the military class: last of all, the king
drew the pen of approbation over whatever was
worthy of the royal majesty. Some of the ancient
kings and all the princes of the remote ages, far from
taking any part of the spoil to their own share, even
made good every injury which happened to the army
in executing the royal orders, as the loss of horses
and such like.</p>

<p>After the victory, they never oppressed the helpless,
the indigent, merchants, travellers, or the
generality of the inhabitants, and the Rayas. Those
<a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 180</span>
who were guilty of such acts were, after conviction,
punished. They divided among them whatever the
enemy had in their flight left on the field of battle:
but whatever in the different realms belonged to the
conquered prince and his near connexions, they
submitted to the royal pleasure. They never slew
or offered violence to the person who threw down
his arms and asked for quarter.</p>

<p>This class of the obedient followers of the <span class="title">Azar
Hushang</span> code were styled <dfn>Farishtah</dfn>, “angelic;”
<dfn>Surúsh</dfn>, “seraphic;” <dfn>Farishtah manish</dfn>, “angel-hearted;”
<dfn>Surúsh manish</dfn>, “seraph-hearted;”
<dfn>Sipásí</dfn>, “adorers;” <dfn>Sahí dín</dfn>, “upright in faith;”
and <dfn>Zanádil</dfn>, “the benevolent;” opposed to whom
are the <dfn>Ahriman</dfn>, the <dfn>Dîvs</dfn>, and the <dfn>Tunádil</dfn>, or
“fierce demons.”</p>

<p>The Divs are of two kinds; the one class subject
to the king of the angels, who, through fear of that
prince, have been compelled to desist from injuring
animated beings; the second kind consists of Dîvs
in the realms of other kings, who break through the
covenants of the law, and slay animals: these in
truth are no other than wolves, tigers, scorpions,
and serpents.</p>

<p>They record that in the time of <span class="person">Ardeshír</span>, the son
of <span class="person">Azád</span>, the son of <span class="person">Babegán</span>,
the son of <span class="person">Nushirván</span>,
there was a Jaiyanian champion by name <span class="person">Farhád</span>,
the son of <span class="person">Alád</span>, who were both ranked among the
<a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 181</span>
distinguished leaders: Alád, when in a state of intoxication,
having slain a sheep with his sword, his
son Farhád, on ascertaining this, made him pass
under the sharp-edged scimitar; the people held him
in detestation, and said: “Thou shouldst have sent
thy father to the king.” He replied, “My father
had committed two criminal actions; the first, in
taking so much wine as to lose his senses; the
second in destroying a sheep. Although it would
have been proper to send him to the king, I
could not suffer any delay to intervene in punishing
his crimes: at present I confess myself guilty
of transgressing the Abadián code, for not submitting
the details of this affair to the king.” He
then ordered himself to be put in chains, and
brought in that state before the king: but his majesty
drew the pen of forgiveness over his crime, and elevated
the apex of his dignity.</p>

<p>Moreover it was necessary to drink wine in a
secret place, as they inflicted due punishment on
whoever was found intoxicated in the public bazar.
In truth, permission to drink wine was only given
in cases of malady, as from the time of the very
ancient sovereigns of the Mahabad dynasty, until
that of <span class="person">Yássán Ajam</span>, no person partook of wine or
strong drinks, except the invalids who were ordered
by the physicians to have recourse to them; and
even they partook of them according to the established
<a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 182</span>
rules: but among the ancient kings, <span class="decoration">i. e.</span>
from Kaiomars’ to Yezdagird, they at first indulged
secretly in wine for the purpose of sensual enjoyment,
under color of conforming to medical ordinances.
At last matters terminated in this, that
wine was openly produced at the banquets, and the
champions in attendance on the king partook of it;
but it was not permitted to be drunk openly in the
bazars or streets.</p>

<p>The king gave audience every day, being seated on
an elevation, that is a <dfn>Tábsár</dfn>, or elevated window:
in the same manner he took his seat in the <dfn>Roz-Gáh</dfn>,
which is a place where, on his rising from the <span class="trans">Tábsár</span>,
he seated himself on a throne: on which occasion
the nobles in attendance were drawn out in
their proper gradations: note, that by giving audience
is meant, turning his attention to the concerns
of mankind. Every decree issued by the king from
the <span class="trans">rozistán</span> or <span class="trans">shabistán</span>
of the interior or exterior,
was transcribed by the Shudahband and again submitted
to the royal presence, and when its promulgation
was ratified, it was laid before his majesty a
second time.</p>

<p>Whenever a traveller entered a caravanserai or
city, the secretaries of the place, in the presence of
witnesses and notaries, made out a statement of his
wealth and effects, which they gave him; and the
same at the time of sale; so that if he should afterwards
<a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 183</span>
declare that his stock had been diminished or
some part had been abstracted, they could ascertain
its value and quantity: there was also a fixed price
assigned to every commodity and article, and also a
certain rate of profit prescribed to each vendor.</p>

<p>The following was their mode of hunting: the
army being drawn out in array, in right, centre, and
left columns, the nobles and eminent warriors took
their several posts according to rank, and during a
period of forty or fifty days formed a circle around
both mountains and plains. If the country abounded
in wood, they formed the whole of it into well secured
piles: the king then directed his steps towards
that quarter, and his train by degrees drove in the
game, keeping up a strict watch that no beast of
prey should escape out of the circle: on this the
king, his sons, and relations dispatched with arrows
as many as they could; after this the king, surrounded
by the most distinguished courtiers, sat on a throne
placed on an eminence, formed of strong timbers so
fastened together that no animal could get up there:
the generals, and then the whole of the soldiery
charged into the centre, so that not a trace remained
of ferocious animals, that is, of lions and such noxious
creatures: they next counted the numbers of
the slain, and having piled them in one place, formed
a hillock of their carcases. If they discovered a
harmless animal amongst the slain, they ordered
<a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 184</span>
vengeance to be inflicted on its destroyer, and cast
his body among those of the ferocious animals.</p>

<p>They record that in the reign of Yássán, the son
of Sháh Mahbúl, an elk had been slain by some
tyrannically-inclined person, on beholding which
the father of the insane criminal, with the ruthless
sword, immediately dissevered his son’s head from
his shoulders. Also in the reign of Núshirvan, the
fortunate descendant from the <span class="title">Sháíyán</span> dynasty, at
one time whilst in the pursuit of game, an arrow
shot intentionally from the bow of a noble champion
named <span class="person">Fartúsh</span>, wounded a deer so that it fell dead:
his son, <span class="person">Ayín Túsh</span>, was perfectly horror-struck, and
in retaliation with an arrow pinned his father’s body
to that of the slaughtered deer; so that, in future,
there should be no infringement of the Farhang law.</p>

<p>As soon as a lofty mound had been formed of
slaughtered noxious creatures, which either walk,
fly, or graze, then by the king’s command a Mobid ascended
the eminence and said: “Such is the recompense
of all who slay harmless creatures; such the
retribution which awaits the destroyers of animals
free from crimes.” He then said to the harmless
creatures: “The equitable king of kings, in order
to destroy the noxious animals which cause you
so many calamities, has come forward in his own
precious person, and taken vengeance for the misdeeds
of these wicked creatures: now depart in
<a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 185</span>
peace; behold the vengeance inflicted on your
sanguinary foes; and commit no sin before the
protector of your species.” They then left a
road open for the innoxious animals to escape and
hasten to their mountains and deserts. This kind
of hunting they called <dfn>Shikár-i-dád</dfn> or <dfn>Dád-shikár</dfn>; i. e.:
“the hunt of equity,” or “the equity-hunt.” The
royal governors also in their respective provinces
adopted a chase of the like description. Whenever
the sovereign was of such a character as not to deviate
from the Farhang code, if any person declined
rendering allegiance to the prince chosen by him for
his successor, that person was immediately destroyed
by the people.</p>

<p>In the reign of <span class="person">Sháh Gilív</span>, a champion having beheld
in a vision, that the king had raised to the
throne one of the princes who met not his approbation,
immediately on awaking put himself to death.
Sháh Gilív, on hearing this, said to the son of the
deceased: “When a person is awake, rebellion is
to be abhorred; but not in a state of sleep, as it is
then involuntary.”</p>

<p>Also in the reign of <span class="person">Bahman</span>, the son of Isfendiar,
the son of <span class="person">Ardashír</span>, the son of
<span class="person">Azad Shai</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_366" id="fnanchor_366"></a><a href="#footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></span>
one of the
<a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 186</span>
generals, <span class="person">Bahram</span> by name, governor of Khorasan,
having made arrangements for revolt and rebellion,
the soldiers on learning his designs put him to death,
and offering up his flesh after the manner of the
Moslem sacrifice, divided it and ate of it, saying,
“He is a noxious animal.”</p>

<p>In the same reign, a champion, by name <span class="person">Gilshásp</span>,
saw in a trance that he had rebelled against Bahman:
on relating the dream to his soldiers, they for
answer drew forth their swords and shed his blood,
saying: “Although there is no blame to be attached
to the vision, yet he is the genius of evil for publishing
it abroad.”</p>

<p><span class="person">Ayín Shakíb</span>, a Móbed, who saw in a vision that he
was uttering imprecations against <span class="person">Ardíshír</span>, the son
of <span class="person">Babagán</span>, the son of <span class="person">Azád</span>
the Jaiyánían, immediately
on awaking cut out his tongue: such was their
devotedness to their kings.</p>

<p>They moreover say, in the case of every prince
who was adorned with sound doctrine, good works,
and noble descent; who promoted the interests of
the military and the happiness of the Ráyás, and
who never deviated from the covenant of the law;
that when any one proved refractory to his commands,
that person’s life and property were confiscated
with justice. The kings made trials of their
sons’ capacities, and conferred the royal dignity
on whichever was found the most deserving; not
<a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 187</span>
making the one king whom they regarded with the
greatest natural affection. They also said: “Sovereign
power becomes not the monarch who transgresses
this blessed law; neither should any
prince give way to the disposition to deviate in the
slightest degree from any of its covenants, lest
from their esteeming one branch of the law as of
no importance, they might regard the whole as of
trifling obligation.” The adorable and almighty
God so gave his aid to these praise-worthy sovereigns
that they decked the bride of dominion with
the ornaments of equity, benevolence, and impartial
justice. Merchants, travellers, and scholars moved
about in perfect security; during their reigns there
existed no annoyance from the payment of tolls, customs,
and other exactions; and in the caravanserais
was neither rent nor hire.</p>

<p>The kings had the covenants of the law transcribed,
which they always kept near them, and had
read over to them daily by some confidential courtier:
on great festivals they were communicated to
the military and the rayas, with strong injunctions
to store them up in their recollection. The Umras
also pursued the same system, and recited the law
to their dependants. In like manner, the princesses
of the <dfn>Shabistán</dfn>, “night-apartment,” observed the
same rule.</p>

<p>They moreover say that every prince who, through
<a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 188</span>
the suggestions of his own mind or of his minister’s,
adopted any measures except in conformity to this
law, bitterly repented of it.&mdash;<span class="person">Jai Alad</span> has said:
“Whoever in the king’s presence utters a word contrary
to the covenants of the law, or persuades
him to do so; the king may rest assured that
the object of that person is to throw the kingdom
into confusion.”</p>

<p>When the Yezdáníán princes and rulers gave audience,
there lay before them a book, a scourge, and
a sword; the book contained the covenants of the
law; and every affair which was submitted to them
being considered according to the view taken of it
in the book, they then gave a decision.</p>

<p>In the royal dynasty which preceded the Gilsháíán
kings, there was no violation whatever of this code;
but under later princes some disorder crept into
its observance. They also say, that whenever they
violated the commands, decrees, maxims, rules, and
decisions of this covenant, they became associated
with regret and repentance. Whenever a sovereign
sustained any injury, it arose principally from inattention
to this standard; and whenever a monarch
lived in prosperity, it proceeded from his scrupulous
observance of the most minute details of this code.
The ancient sovereigns, that is, the <span class="title">Abádíán</span>,
the <span class="title">Jaiyán</span>,
the <span class="title">Shaiyán</span> and the <span class="title">Yassánían</span>,
who are the most
renowned of kings, never lost sight of the Farhang
<a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 189</span>
Abád, that is, they did every thing according to its
dictates: this code they also called <dfn>Hirbud Sár</dfn>, or
“sacerdotal purity.” During this period no enemy
arose, and no foe obtained the supremacy; the military
and the rayas enjoyed undisturbed repose.
Amongst the <span class="title">Gilsháíyán</span> kings,
<span class="person">Hushang</span>, <span class="person">Tahmúras</span>,
<span class="person">Faridun</span>, <span class="person">Minuchahar</span>,
<span class="person">Kaikobád</span>, <span class="person">Kaikhusró</span>,
<span class="person">Lohorasp</span>,
<span class="person">Bahman</span>, <span class="person">Ardashir Babágán</span>,
and the others, had this
code transcribed in secret characters, which they
employed as mental amulets and spiritual charms.
<span class="person">Náshirván</span> also, having procured a transcript of this
law, kept it by him. Although all the sovereigns
conformed to this rule, yet none observed it in so
high a degree as the ancient sovereigns of the <span class="title">Abádíán</span>,
<span class="title">Jaiyán</span>, <span class="title">Shaiyán</span>,
and <span class="title">Yassáníán</span> dynasties: as in
the belief held by the <span class="title">Yazdanians</span>, or “theists,” their
dignity so far transcends that of the Gilsháíyáns,
that we can institute no comparison between them.
The Gilsháíyán princes also exerted themselves to
prevent the slaughter of harmless animals; although
the people did not pay the same respect to their
orders as to those of the ancient sovereigns, yet, as
compared with their successors, people were more
exact in the performance of duty than in later
periods.</p>

<p>They say that <span class="person">Rustam</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_367" id="fnanchor_367"></a><a href="#footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a></span>
the son of <span class="person">Zaul</span>, at the moment
<a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 190</span>
of abandoning the robes of mortality, having
heaved a deep sigh, the king of Kabúl said to him:
“O Rustam! art thou alarmed at death?” the hero
replied: “God forbid! for the death of the body is
to the spirit the bestowing of life; and the issuing
forth under the sphere is the being born from the
maternal womb; when the cloud of the body is
removed, the sun of spirit shines more resplendently:
but my grief proceeded from this reflection,
that when Kaús commanded Tús to put me
to the ignominious death of the
gibbet,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_368" id="fnanchor_368"></a><a href="#footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></span>
I refused
to submit to the punishment. Although Kaús,
<a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 191</span>
in violation of the Farhang code, had passed a
sentence opposed to the decisions of Mahabád,
and even the interests of Kaús were ultimately
advanced by my rebellious conduct, I am at present
afflicted on that account, lest, perhaps, any
thing opposed to the Farhang code may have
proceeded from me. In like manner Isfendiar
was slain by my hand,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_369" id="fnanchor_369"></a><a href="#footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a></span>
and I refused to be put
in chains; although it became him not to exact
compliance, nor was it in accordance with the
Farhang code.” Dastan (Zaul) also lived in regret,
<a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 192</span>
saying: “Why did I utter a word in opposition to
Kai Khusran, on the day when he chose Lohorasp
as his successor, although my sentiments
were expressed by way of
counsel?”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_370" id="fnanchor_370"></a><a href="#footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a></span>
When
Bahman, the son of Isfendiar, made preparations
for laying waste Sistan, notwithstanding the people
urged Dastan to give the invaders battle, he approved
not of it, but said: “Never more will I break through
the Farhang code.” He then came on foot into
the presence of Bahman, by whose orders he was
thrown into chains: but he finally attained the king’s
unbounded esteem, and was released; whilst his
son Faramarz, contrary to the Farhang code, gave
the king battle, and, being taken prisoner, suffered
the ignominious death of the
gibbet:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_371" id="fnanchor_371"></a><a href="#footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></span>
his son was
<a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 193</span>
also put to death on the same account. The implicit
obedience of the son <span class="person">Minufarad</span> to
Kobad,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_372" id="fnanchor_372"></a><a href="#footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a></span> the
father of Nushirvan, is also well known; although
that prince was not strictly entitled to obedience
according to the Farhang covenant, yet the devotedness
of his subjects is highly celebrated.</p>

castration, and especially upon youths distinguished by their beauty
(<abbr title="Herodotus liber Six">Herod. lib. VI</abbr>). They are even accused of having been the first among

 At the time that a great army of Turanians commanded by Sohrab
overrun Persia, Rustam, the ruler of Sistan, was summoned by Káús, his
liege, to repulse the invaders. Rustam, although willing to obey, having
spent some days in feasting, appeared later than his sovereign expected,
who, in a fit of rage, after having severely rebuked him for his tardiness,
condemned him to an ignominious death. Gív, one of the principal
chiefs, and friend of Rustam, was charged with the execution, but, refusing
to do what he felt impossible, he was sentenced to share the fate of
the great hero, and Tus, a chief mentioned in the text, received the order
to execute the mandate upon both. A reconciliation however took place
between the king and his powerful vassals, whose united efforts were
required against the Turanians. It was in the course of this war that
Rustam slew his son Sohrab, without knowing him, and without supposing
him at the head of the Turanian army: this is the subject of one of the
most celebrated episodes of Ferdusi’s Shah-namah.&mdash;<abbr title="Anthony Troyer">A. T.</abbr></p>

 Isfendiar, the son of Gushtasp, several times mentioned in the course
of this work, adopted, like his father, and zealously propagated, Zoroaster’s
religion, which caused a new war between the Persians and Turanians.
Arjasp, the sovereign of Túr, having invaded Persia, Isfendiar
was called to the assistance of his father, who promised the throne to him
if he repulsed the invaders; but, delivered from danger by his son’s successful
exertions, Gushtasp, unwilling to fulfil his promise, readily listened
to suggestions about the treacherous designs of Isfendiar whom he emprisoned.
Arjasp, profiting by this event, marched to Balkh, killed Lohrasp,
the father of Gushtasp, carried off the two daughters of the latter,
whom he defeated in a battle and pent up in a fortress. Isfendiar, called
out from his prison, routed the Turanian army and released his father.
Moreover, he rescued his two sisters (one of whom was his wife) from captivity,
by taking the strong residence of Arjasp, whom he killed with his
own hand. He was not even then to enjoy the well-deserved reward,
but charged with the most perilous expedition to bring Rustam in chains
before the throne of his discontented liege. In vain did the hero just
mentioned proffer his willingness to submit to any terms of submission
except that of being enchained; nothing less than this was insisted upon:
a combat became necessary, in which Isfendiar reduced his great antagonist
to have recourse to the miraculous aid of Simurgh (see <a href="#footnote_290">note,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 55</a>); by this
alone Rustam was enabled to kill Isfendiar in a renewed
combat.&mdash;<abbr title="Anthony Troyer">A. T.</abbr></p>

 Káí Khusró, after a glorious reign of sixty years, resolved to resign
the crown. He assembled in a plain all his chiefs and the people of
Iran. After a magnificent festival of seven days, he proclaimed his final
determination; divided the empire among several chiefs, and appointed
Lohrasp the successor of his sovereignty. This choice met with some
opposition on the part of the aged Zaul (see Rauzat-us-Safa, Shea’s
<abbr title="translation">transl.</abbr>,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 263), and although this chief yielded to the sovereign will, yet he never
paid homage to the new king; and a pernicious misunderstanding remained
between the descendants of both parties. It may be remarked that Káí
Khusró’s abdication is quite Indian. According to Ferdúsi, it was towards
the mountains of India, called Amajal, that Káí Khusró bent his steps,
accompanied by a number of his chiefs, the most ancient of whom he
soon dismissed, whilst others followed him further, although warned by
him of an impending storm of snow which was to bury them all. He
suddenly disappeared, and they were never heard of. This reminds of
more than one similar event in Indian history.&mdash;<abbr title="Anthony Troyer">A. T.</abbr></p>

 This account agrees with the Shah-namah, according to which Bahman,
in order to revenge the death of his father (see note last but one),
invaded Sistan and took Zaul with all his treasures. It was then that
Farámars, the son of Rustam, encountered the Persians in a battle: he
was defeated, taken prisoner, and hanged. According to the Rauzat-us-Safa
(see Shea’s <abbr title="translation">transl.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 340),
Bahman, on reaching Zabulistan, heard
of Rustam’s death; his son Farámans fell, and Zaul was taken

 Kobad, the Cabades or Cavades of the Greeks, the eighteenth king of
the Sassanians, ruled 43 years in Persia from 488 to 531, A. D., not ingloriously
within and without his empire, from which he was however
driven on account of the support which he gave to the new and dangerous
doctrine of the prophet Mazdak, about whom see section <abbr title="Fifteen">XV</abbr> of this
chapter. Kobad recovered the throne by the assistance of the Tartar
prince Hestial (see Ferdusi’s Shah-namah), or (see Herbelot) by that of the
nations, called Haïathelah, who inhabit the countries of Kandahar, Thibet,
and Barantolah.&mdash;<abbr title="Anthony Troyer">A. T.</abbr></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="sc">The fourth section of the Dabistan</span> contains an
account of the Jamshaspian sect. The <span class="title">Yekanah-binan</span>,
“seers of unity,” also called the Jamshaí,
who form another great body of the Parsees, are the
followers of <span class="person">Jamshasp</span>, the son of
<span class="person">Jemshid</span>, the son of
<span class="person">Tahmúras</span>: in their speech there is much that is
enigmatical, and endless subtilty. Jamshasp never
invited any one to follow his tenets, but he was
of such exemplary life and so great a sage, that the
<a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 194</span>
people bore him great affection, and wrote down his
sayings, until by degrees great numbers voluntarily
adopted them as articles of faith. According to
them, the world has no external existence; they
hold that whatever exists is God, and that naught
exists besides him: a holy man has said:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“Every eye which is directed to the primitive nature,</div>
  <div class="i0">Unless tinged with the collyrium of divine light,</div>
  <div class="i0">Whatever it beholds in the world, except thy face,</div>
  <div class="i0">Is but the second image of distorted vision.”</div>
 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>They hold that all the intelligences, souls, angels,
heavens, stars, elements, the animal, vegetable, and
mineral kingdoms exist within his knowledge, and
are not external to it: which sentiment king Jamshid
explained to Abtin, saying: “Know, O Abtin,
that the Almighty conceived in idea the first intelligence;
in like manner the first intelligence conceived
three objects, namely, the second intelligence,
the soul of the upper sphere, and the body
of the same heaven: in like manner, the second
intelligence conceived three objects, and so on in
succession to the elements and their combinations:
and this is exactly as when we form an idea of a
city, with its palaces, gardens, and inhabitants,
which in reality have no existence external to our
imagination; so that, consequently, the existence
of this world is of the same description.” The
Abadian regard these sayings as enigmatical, although
<a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 195</span>
Jamshid composed many philosophical
works, which the Yekanah Binan admit without
any commentary: many of the Parsees adopt this
creed, and particularly the ascetics of that class.
The belief of these sectaries is illustrated by the
following tetrastich from Subahani:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“The sophist, who has no knowledge of intellect,</div>
  <div class="i0">Asserts that this world is altogether an optical illusion,</div>
  <div class="i0">In truth, the world is an illusion; however,</div>
  <div class="i0">Certainty is for ever displaying her effulgence there.”</div>
 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>On this subject they have composed various
works, the most celebrated of which is, the “Testament
of Jamshid addressed to Abtin,” compiled by
<span class="person">Farhang Dostoor</span>. <span class="person">Shídah</span>,
<span class="person">Suhráb</span>, <span class="person">Mízan</span>, and <span class="person">Jamshásp</span>,

<p class="p4"><span class="sc">The fifth section of the Dabistan</span> describes the
Samrádián sect.&mdash;In common language Samrád
means imagination and thought; and the sects thus
named are of many descriptions; the first is that of
the followers of <span class="person">Fartósh</span>, who lived about the commencement
of the Serpent-shouldered <span class="person">Zohak</span>’s reign:
<span class="person">Fartósh</span> followed mercantile pursuits, and his faith
was as follows: this elemental world is merely
idea; the remainder, the heavens, the stars, and
the simple uncompounded beings actually exist.
<a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 196</span>
The holders of this opinion are called the <dfn>Fartoshíán</dfn>.</p>

<p>The second are the <span class="title">Farshídíyah</span>, so called from <span class="person">Farshíd</span>,
the son of <span class="person">Fartósh</span>: he asserted that the heavens
and the stars are also ideal, and that the simple uncompounded
beings only have actual existence.</p>

<p>The next are the <span class="title">Farírajíyah</span>, so called from <span class="person">Faríraj</span>,
the son of <span class="person">Farshid</span>: his opinion was that the
simple uncompounded beings, that is, intelligences
and souls, also have no existence, which is the attribute
of the necessarily self-existent God alone, and
that all besides is ideal, appearing only to exist in
consequence of the essence of that sole existence.</p>

<p>The next are the <span class="title">Faramandíyah</span>, thus named from
<span class="person">Faramand</span>, the disciple of <span class="person">Faríraj</span>: he says, if any
person exists, that person knows that the elements,
heavens, stars, intelligences, and souls are the Almighty;
and what people call the necessarily self-existent
God has no being, although we, through
imagination (idea), suppose him to exist; which he
certainly does not. According to the testimony of
the sage <span class="person">Amr Khaiam</span>:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“The Creator in this aged world is as a vase,</div>
  <div class="i0">Which is internally water and externally ice;</div>
  <div class="i0">Resign to children this trifling about infidelity and faith;</div>
  <div class="i0">Remove from the place where God is only a letter.”</div>
 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>They said to him: “How dost thou prove this
idea?” he answered:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“By means of the solar light we can see: but where is the sun?”</div>
 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 197</span>
Thus, according to them, the Almighty is only
an idea of the imagination: the people of this sect
are now mixed up with the Moslems, and go about
in the garb of the faithful: according to them a person
named <span class="person">Kámkár</span>, one of the ascetics of this sect,
who lived in the reign of sultan <span class="person">Mahmud of
Ghiznah</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_373" id="fnanchor_373"></a><a href="#footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a></span>
composed a poetical treatise, and compiled
narratives, proofs, and revelations conformable to
his tenets; assigning to his faith a superiority over
all other systems, after this manner: that, whatever
devout persons have recorded in their respective
creeds concerning the existence of God, the greatness
of the empyreal sphere, the extent of the angelic
world, or concerning paradise, hell, the bridge
of judgment, the resurrection of the dead, the
interrogatory and
reply,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_374" id="fnanchor_374"></a><a href="#footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a></span>
the appearing before God,
the rejection of tradition, eternity, and the creation
of the world, is all correct in this creed; as all becomes
evident to the idea of their professor through
the existence of idea; with respect to which they
thus express themselves: “by means of idea, they
<a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 198</span>
behold the ideal.” In proof of his system, he
farther says: “Self cannot be ignorant of self.”
But in truth they are ignorant of their own identity,
and understand not in what “self” consists: some
of them maintain, that the being called man and
endowed with voice and speech, is an incorporeal
essence joined to the body; the relations of thought
and action resulting merely from its entrance or
descent into body: notwithstanding this principle,
they differ greatly among themselves respecting the
eternity and creation of their own souls. In like
manner, some have also denied the simple uncompoundedness
of the intellectual soul, and have spoken
largely against that doctrine; consequently, as they
are unacquainted with their own identity, what can
they know about the heavens, stars, intelligences,
and God? and it becomes not that one should know
nothing about himself, but that he exists not. Kámkár,
in his treatise, has collected many amusing
anecdotes respecting the Samrádián sect, of which
the following is an instance: a Samradian once said
to his steward: “The world and its inhabitants have
no actual existence; they merely have an ideal
being.” The servant, on hearing this, took the
first favorable opportunity to conceal his master’s
horse, and when he was about to ride, brought him
an ass with the horse’s saddle. When the Samrádián
asked, “Where is the horse?” the servant replied,
<a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 199</span>
“Thou hast been thinking of an idea: there
was no horse in being.” The master answered,
“It is true:” he then mounted the ass, and having
rode for some time, he suddenly dismounted, and
taking the saddle off the ass’s back, placed it on the
servant’s, drawing the girths on tightly; and having
forced the bridle into his mouth, he mounted him
and flogged him along vigorously. The servant, in
piteous accents, having exclaimed: “What is the
meaning of this conduct?” the Samrádián replied:
“There is no such thing as a whip; it is merely
ideal; thou art only thinking of some illusion:”
after which the steward repented and restored the
horse.</p>

<p>In another tale it is recorded that a Samrádián,
having obtained in marriage the daughter of a
wealthy lawyer, she, on finding out her husband’s
creed, proposed to have some amusement at his
expense. One day the Samradian brought in a
bottle of pure wine, which during his absence she
emptied of its contents and filled it up with water;
when the time for taking wine came round, she
poured out water instead of wine into a gold cup
which was her own property. The Samrádián
having observed, “Thou hast given me water instead
of wine,” she answered, “It is only ideal;
there was no wine in existence.” The husband
then said: “Thou hast spoken well; present me
<a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 200</span>
the cup, that I may go to a neighbour’s house and
bring it back full of wine.” He therefore took
out the gold cup, which he sold, and concealing the
money, instead of the gold vase brought back an
earthen vessel full of wine. The wife, on seeing this,
said, “What hast thou done with the golden cup?”
he replied, “Thou art surely thinking about some
ideal golden cup:” on which the woman greatly
regretted her witticism.</p>

<p>As to those sectaries who assert that the world
exists only in idea, the author of this work saw
several in Lahore, in the year of the Hejirah 1048,
A. D. 1637. The first was <span class="person">Kám Jóí</span>, who composed
the following distichs on <span class="person">Faríraj</span>:</p>

 Mahmud, the son of Sebekteghin, was the first monarch of the dynasty
of Ghiznah, the foundation of which had been laid by his father. During
a reign of 33 years (from 997 to 1030, A. D.) he made twelve expeditions
to India, and established his domination in the western part of this
country, out of which he possessed a still greater empire, which to the

Khodádád held intelligences and souls to be simple
uncompounded beings, and the stars and heavens to
be the companions of God; each of which, in proportion
to its proximity to the Almighty beyond
other created beings, is so much more elevated in
dignity: notwithstanding which we are not to account
any being, whether the simple uncompounded
or material, as a mediator or promoter between us
and God; neither is there any occasion for prophets,

out of God is attained, and we are to serve God

hero, who, to beneficent acts and abstinence from
cruelty to animals, joined the dignity of knowledge;
he enjoyed distinguished honor and rank about the
end of Jamshíd’s reign and the commencement of
Zohák’s usurpation: his opinion is, that God is the
same as the sun, whose bounty extends to all beings;
and that the fourth heaven, by reason of its constituting
the true centre of the seven heavens, is the
seat of his glory and as his essence is pure good,
his place must also be regarded as a proof of his
goodness: besides this, his grace extends alike to
all bodies, whether superior or inferior: moreover,
as the heart, which is the sovereign of the body, is
settled in the midst of the breast, such is also the
rule and custom observed by renowned princes to
fix the seat of government in the centre of their
realms, so that their bounty as well as severity may
be equally extended over the whole community;
and, by such a measure, the repose of the people
and the due regulations of the Rayas may be promoted.
He asserted that the spirit of the heavens,
the stars, and the three kingdoms of nature proceed
from the solar spirit, and that their bodies return to
the light of his body; that is, the virtuous return to
him or some of the stars approximating to his glory,
whilst sinners remain in the elemental world. He
at first communicated these opinions secretly to his
friends, but promulgated them fearlessly during the

is differently stated to have been in Persia, in Babylonia, in Nishapúr,
in Khorossan. He is reputed as a learned man, as will be shewn in a
subsequent note. He appeared at the court of king Shápur, the son of Ardeshir
Babegan, but inhabited chiefly Turkistan. As a painter, he exhibited
a set of pictures, called <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">ارتنگ</span>,
<span class="trans">artang</span>; or <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">ارژنگ</span>,
<span class="trans">arzhank</span>; or
<span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">ارچنگ مانی</span>, <span class="trans">archang Máni</span>,
which he said he had brought from
heaven, where he pretended to have dwelt, whilst in reality he was concealed
in a cavern during one year. The baron Hammer Purgstal suggests
that the <dfn>artang</dfn> might have been a banner or ensign, upon which astronomical
or cabalistical figures were represented, and which the Mongols
and Buddhists used to call <span class="title">Máni</span> (see
<abbr title="Jahrbuch der Literatur" lang="de" xml:lang="de">Jahrb. der Lit.</abbr>, for April, May,
June, 1840, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 28). Máni was besides a skilful musician, and inventor of
a musical instrument, called <span class="trans">âu´d</span> by the Arabs,
<span class="trans">chelys</span> by the Greeks.
He was put to death by order of king Bahram, the son of Hormuz, about
the year 278; by some authors his life and death are placed later.&mdash;See

was a native of Iran, celebrated
for his extensive knowledge, who lived in
reputation and dignity about the end of Zohák’s
reign, under whose command he distinguished himself
in the erection of forts and other architectural
works. His belief was, that God is the same as
water, from the ebullition of which proceeded fire;
from the fire came forth the heavens and the stars (as
before stated); from the humidity of water proceeded
the air, and from its frigidity, the earth. To this
sect belonged <span class="person">Andarímán</span>, who was well skilled in
the management of the bow, archery, wielding the
lance, horsemanship, and other military accomplishments;
he gave instructions in these sciences to the
sons of great men, in which occupation he passed
his life. In the year of the Hejirah 1040 (A. D. 1630)
the author met him in Kashmir at the house of <span class="person">Shidosh</span>.
To this sect also belonged <span class="person">Mílád</span>, who possessed
consummate skill in writing, and was held in
great respect by men of high station: he was in truth
<a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 207</span>
unequalled in the recitation of histories, the narration
of stories and romantic tales. The author
enjoyed his society also in Kashmir.</p>

<p class="p4"><span class="sc">The twelfth section</span> treats concerning
the <span class="title">Shidabian</span>
faith.&mdash;<span class="person">Shádíb</span> who lived about the end of
<span class="person">Zohák</span>’s
reign, was an eminent physician of Iran, held
in great estimation by nobles and princes. He maintained
that the self-existent lord is the same with
the earth, from the dry propensity of which was
produced fire; and from fire the heavens and stars,
as before mentioned; from its frigidity proceeded
water; from the humidity of which was formed the
air; and when the four elements were mixed together,
the three kingdoms of nature were then manifested.
The physician <span class="person">Mihrán</span> was also of this sect.
In the year 1018 of the Hejirah (A. D. 1638) the
author joined him, and travelled in his society from
Lahore to Kashmir. Among those who held these
tenets was one named <span class="person">Khákí</span>, who followed the profession
of a merchant and possessed great wealth:
him the author met in Lahore. In that same year
and in the same place, he became acquainted with
a young man named <span class="person">Shír</span>, who excelled in writing
the Nishki and Taalik characters, and was one of the
chosen followers of <span class="person">Shídáb</span>.</p>

<p class="p4"><span class="sc">The thirteenth section</span> describes the system of
<a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 208</span>
the <span class="title">Akhshíyán</span> sect.&mdash;The Mobed
<span class="person">Akhshí</span> was by origin
a Persian, possessed of great knowledge, and full
of kindness towards the creatures of God; he was
contemporary with <span class="person">Shídáb</span>, and promulgated his
sentiments openly, inviting all men to embrace his
faith: he maintained God to be the essence of the
elements; so that when people say, “God is not
visible,” this implies the elemental essence, which
presents no form to the sight; when they assert the
ubiquity of God, they style that the essence, as he is
every where under his fourfold form; their proposition
of all things excepting God being perishable,
means that the elements admit of change, but that
their essence remains for ever in the same state.
They hold the sun to be the source of fire and of the
other stars, such as the falling and shooting stars,
comets with tails, etc. One of those sectaries was
a person named <span class="person">Shídáb</span>, whom the author met in
the costume of a merchant, in Kashmir in the year of
the Hejirah 1040 (A. D. 1631), and from whom he
heard what has now been written, and which was
partly recited out of the book of <span class="title">Akshí</span>. The same
<span class="person">Shídáb</span>, called also <dfn>Shams-ud-dîn</dfn>, or “the sun of
faith,” composed a treatise entitled <cite>Rázábád</cite> in
proof of his system, which he demonstrated by texts
of the Koran and the traditions. According to these
sectaries, which became known after the <span class="title">Radiyán</span>,
there is no resurrection nor return to life but after
<a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 209</span>
this manner: the seminal principle being derived
from food, when the body of a living creature is dissolved,
it becomes grass and constitutes the food of
some other animal: as to future rewards and punishments,
they enter not into the faith or practice of
this sect: their paradise consists in having fine raiment,
in carousing, riding, sensual enjoyments, and
such like pleasures, which alone they esteem the
chief good; torment, according to them, consists in
being separated from such objects: however, the
founders and followers of this faith carefully avoid
all kind of cruelty towards living creatures.</p>

<p>According to them, intercourse with daughters,
sisters, mothers, maternal aunts, and their children
is allowable;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_379" id="fnanchor_379"></a><a href="#footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></span>
as there can exist no antipathy between
<a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 210</span>
the source and what is derived from it: no degree
of relationship in their opinion should be a bar
to the intercourse of the sexes: nay, on the contrary,
it is highly to be commended, as the nearer the degree
of consanguinity, the greater will be the friendship
between the parties.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_380" id="fnanchor_380"></a><a href="#footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></span>
They however regard
adultery as highly criminal, unless the husband
should willingly sacrifice his wife’s honor. They in
fact maintain that marriage between any two parties,
however nearly related, is perfectly allowable if the
parties agree among themselves. They also regard
the ceremonial ablutions enjoined by the law as
absurd and unnecessary.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_381" id="fnanchor_381"></a><a href="#footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></span>
They also say, that men
assume a particular nature by means of laws and
institutions, and on that account regard good as
evil, and evil as good. When they desire to make
a sacrificial offering, they kill some harmless animal
and count it not a foul crime. Nay, some religionists
who partake of swine’s flesh, scrupulously avoid
that of cows, and <span class="decoration">vice versâ</span>. Whoever shall appeal
to the intelligence, which is the gift of God, will be
convinced that our discourse is true; that is, all we
<a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 211</span>
have narrated from the fifth chapter to the present.
The professors of this belief are mixed up with the
Muhammedans, and travel about under that mask,
assuming the name of true believers, but having a
distinct appellation for their peculiar creed; they are
scattered over Iran and Turan, remote from and
averse to the fire-worshippers.</p>

<p class="p2 footnote"> <a name="footnote_379" id="footnote_379"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_379"><span class="muchsmaller">[379]</span></a>
 According to Philo and to Diogenes Laertius, the Persians used to
marry their mothers and sisters. Alexander abolished these incestuous
marriages (see <cite>Brisson</cite>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 290). We
know from Herodotus (<abbr title="One">I</abbr>: 111) that
Cambyses married his sister Atossa. According to Strabo, the law permitted
the Magians union with their mothers. Plutarch, in the life of Artaxerxes,
relates that this king took to wife his two daughters Atossa and
Amestris; but his mother Parysatis (<dfn>Pari-dokht</dfn>, “daughter of a fairy”),
at the very time she was engaging him to marry the first of his daughters,
said that he must, in doing so, place himself above the laws of the
country. Zoroaster, in the Zand books, recommends but the marriages
between the children of brothers and sisters as actions deserving heaven.
We observe that the author of the Dabistan speaks here only of a particular
sect, the custom of which might have been attributed to the whole
nation of the Persians, but without sufficient foundation. This is confirmed
by the ancient tradition mentioned by Agathius (<abbr title="liber">l.</abbr> 11), who says,
that Ninus killed his own mother Semiramis, because she had proposed to
him an unnatural connection with her. For this same reason, according
to the author just quoted, Artaxerxes is said to have discarded from
him with great indignation his mother Parysatis, although he did not
decline the marriage with his two daughters.&mdash;(See <cite>Hyde</cite>,

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="sc">The fourteenth section</span> of this chapter of the Dabistán
treats of the followers of
<span class="person">Zardúsht</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_382" id="fnanchor_382"></a><a href="#footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></span>&mdash;<span class="person">Farzanah</span>
<a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 212</span>
<span class="person">Bahram</span>, the son of <span class="person">Farhad</span>, the Yazdanian, thus
relates in the <span class="title">Sharistan</span>: The <span class="title">Behdín</span> sages relate, that
the Almighty, on creating the holy spirit of Zardúsht,
<a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 213</span>
attached it to a tree, when he commenced
the creation of contingent beings in the highest starry
heavens: this signifies the primary intellect, which
is as a tree, the leaves and fruits of which are all
contingent existences; and their assertion concerning
the spirit of Zardúsht being attached to it, means
that his intellectual soul is a ray of the primary intellect,
the perfections of Zardúsht being also an effulgence
proceeding from that same tree. The Mobed
<span class="person">Sarúsh</span>, the Yazdánián, relates: “The teachers of the
<span class="title">Behdín</span> faith have thus said: The father of Zardúsht
had a cow which went forth every morning to the
pasture: having one day come accidentally to some
trees, the fallen leaves of which had become dried
up, she partook of them, and after that occurrence,
never fed on any other provender except the
<a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 214</span>
withered leaves of that grove. Zardúsht’s father
partook of the milk supplied by this cow, and the
influence of it being communicated to his wife Dughduyah,
she conceived <span class="person">Zardúsht</span>.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_383" id="fnanchor_383"></a><a href="#footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></span>
The object of the
above narrative is to show, that by eating the green
foliage, the vegetable spirit is afflicted; for which
reason the cow fed only on dry leaves, so that no
injury could result to any spirit whatever: although,
in fact, the vegetable spirit is incapable of receiving
either pleasure or pain, it also shows, that unless a
cow be milked, she feels great pain in the udder,
whilst, at the time of milking, no pain ensues from
the operation; also, that the Almighty formed his
prophet’s body out of milk, which in its essence
implies no injury to any living creature. This much
being premised, <span class="person">Zaratusht Bahram</span>, a Mobed of the
religion of Zardusht,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_384" id="fnanchor_384"></a><a href="#footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a></span>
says: When the world had
been thrown into confusion by the wicked, and was
entirely at the mercy of the demon, God willed to
raise up a prophet of an exalted dignity, which the
<a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 215</span>
family of Faridun was alone worthy of filling. In
those days lived a man, by name <span class="person">Purshásp</span>, the son
of <span class="person">Patirásp</span>, descended from
Faridun;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_385" id="fnanchor_385"></a><a href="#footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></span>
and his wife’s
name was <span class="person">Doghduyah</span>, a virtuous matron, who was
also of the family of Faridun. These two persons
were selected by the Almighty as the shells for enclosing
the pearl of Zardusht. When five months
of Doghduyah’s pregnancy had elapsed, she one
night beheld in a dream her house enveloped in a
dark cloud, which concealed the splendor of the sun
and moon; and from this cloud were raining down
the noxious and rapacious creatures of earth and
air; the boldest of these animals having rent open
Doghduyah’s womb, took out the infant, which
he held in his talons, and the other wild beasts
gathered around him. Doghduyah in her alarm
wished to cry out, but Zardusht prevented her,
saying: “the just God befriends me; entertain
no apprehensions.” She consequently held her
<a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 216</span>
peace. That instant she beheld a shining mountain
which descended from heaven and rent the black
cloud asunder; on which the noxious animals began
to fly away. When the mountain approached
nearer, there came forth from it a youth shining all
over, bearing in one hand a luminous branch, and
in the other the volume sent by the just God. He
next hurled that volume towards the beasts, on
which they all departed from the house, excepting
three; a wolf, a lion, and a tiger: the youth then
smote these with the luminous branch, so that they
were consumed by fire; after this, taking Zardusht,
he restored him to his mother’s belly, and said to
her: “Fear not! grieve not! for God himself is
thy son’s guardian: this honored child shall be
the prophet of the just God!” The youth then
disappeared, and Doghduyah awaking, rose up that
gloomy night, and hastening to a neighbouring seer
who was skilled in the interpretation of dreams,
related her
vision.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_386" id="fnanchor_386"></a><a href="#footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a></span>
The interpreter answered:
“Through this sun-resembling child, the world
shall be filled with thy fame; depart, and bring
hither the calculation of thy nativity for my inspection.”
She performed his command; and the
interpreter on examining it said: “During three
<a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 217</span>
days keep this secret concealed from all; return
hither on the fourth day, and receive the answer
to thy demands.” She did so; and on the
fourth day came to the astrologer, who smiled on
beholding her, and having carefully considered the
sidereal influences, turned to the interpretation of
the dream, saying: “The night on which thou
beheldest that vision, the unborn child had completed
five months and twenty-three days; on his
issuing forth to the couch of existence, his illustrious
name shall be Zardusht; by him shall the
enemies of the faith be destroyed; but they will
previously oppose him in battle, and put in practice
every hostile measure; from the evil doers
thou shalt feel much affliction, such as thou didst
witness from the wild beasts of the vision.</p>

  <div class="i0">And through this unborn child feel all a mother’s joy.</div>

<p class="unindent">Next thou beheldest a youth descending from the
sixth heaven with the glittering branch of a tree;
that was <dfn>Farrah-i-Izad</dfn>, ‘the splendor of God,’
the warder of evils from thy son; the written
volume in his hand is the emblem of the prophetic
office, by which he is to obtain the victory over
all foes; the three wild beasts which remained
behind are the type of a powerful evil-disposed
enemy, who by wiles will endeavour to destroy
Zardusht, but who shall be finally discomfited;
<a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 218</span>
and there shall be a prince to promulgate the
faith: through his might shall Zardusht become
sovereign of this world and the next. O Doghduyah!
paradise is the recompense of obedience
to Zardusht, and hell is the reward of those who
avert the face from him. Would to heaven that
I could live in the days of his mission, to exhibit
my zeal for his eminent dignity.” Doghduyah
then said to the interpreter and astrologer:
“How hast thou found out the circumstance of the
exact period of my pregnancy?” To this he
replied: “Through the power of knowledge of the
stars, and the perusal of ancient records, which
give an account of his auspicious existence.”
Doghduyah, on her return home, told this event to
<span class="person">Purshasp</span>, that he might communicate it to <span class="person">Patírasp</span>;
on which both parents joined in praising the Almighty.
Zaradusht, on issuing forth into the abode
of existence, laughed aloud at the moment of his
birth,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_387" id="fnanchor_387"></a><a href="#footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></span>

<p><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 219</span>

<p>All the women became jealous at the laugh of
Zaradusht, and this wonderful occurrence was
spread abroad, until it came to the hearing of <span class="person">Darán
Sarún</span>, the king of that region, who gloried in the
practice of magic and the worship of Ahriman. He
had information of the appearance of Zaratusht, and
it was known from the historians and astronomers
that he will reveal a better religion and destroy that
of Ahriman. He therefore hastened to the pillow of
Zaradusht, and commanding him to be taken out of
the cradle, and putting his hand to his sword, prepared
to cut off the child’s head; but that instant
his hand was dried up, so that he left the house in
pain and affliction; on which all the magicians and
worshippers of Ahriman (the only worship which prevailed
at that time) became quite alarmed. The magicians
then formed a mountain of wood, naphtha,
and sulphur, and having set it on fire, threw into
the midst of it Zaradusht, whom they had by force
taken from his father, and hastened with this intelligence
to their king: but, through the aid of God,</p>

<div class="poem-container">

<p class="unindent"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 220</span>
On learning this, Zaradusht’s mother hurried to
the desert, and taking her honored son out of the
embers, bore him secretly home. After many days,
when the account of his deliverance was published
abroad, the magicians, evil spirits, and demons
again bore Zardusht away, and threw him into a
narrow place, a thoroughfare for the passage of
oxen, that he should be exposed to be bruised and
trampled under foot. Through the goodness of God,
a powerful cow came in front, and, standing still,
took Zardusht between her fore feet, and drove off
with her horns whatever cow came in that direction:
when the whole had passed, she also went to join
them; and Doghduyah, after great search, having
discovered her honored son, took him home: when
this intelligence came to Dúransarún, he commanded
them to expose Zardusht in a far narrower defile
through which horses were to pass; but, owing to
divine aid, a mare advanced before the others, and
standing at the child’s head kept a strict watch over
him, and Doghduyah, after encountering great
hardship, bore her fortunate offspring home. On
learning this occurrence, Dúransarún ordered persons
to repair to the dens of the ravening wolves,
and having slaughtered their cubs, then expose Zardusht
in the same place, in order that the dams
out of revenge might tear him to pieces. At night,
when the troop of wolves returned to their lairs,
<a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 221</span>
they beheld their cubs slaughtered and weltering in
blood, and at the same time finding an infant crying
out, they all hurried towards him; the chief wolf
and the boldest of them, having rushed on to devour
Zardusht, his mouth became as sewn up: at this
miracle the wolves were altogether alarmed, and
seated themselves like so many nurses around the
infant’s head; at the same time there also came two
sheep from the mountain region, which applied their
teats filled with milk to the lips of Zardusht: thus
the sheep and the wolf lay down in one place.
With the morning dawn, his mother, after anxious
seeking and searching, came to that frightful place,
raised up the exalted prophet, and having poured
out her gratitude to God, proceeded with exultation
to her home.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_389" id="fnanchor_389"></a><a href="#footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a></span>
The magicians, on hearing this
miracle, became quite despondent; they assembled
to devise some remedy, and formed a council for
the purpose of deliberating, when a celebrated magician
named <span class="person">Purtarúsh</span> and
<span class="person">Parantarúsh</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_390" id="fnanchor_390"></a><a href="#footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></span>
said to them:
“Zardusht is not to be destroyed by your plans,
for God befriends him, and the angel <dfn>Far-i-Izad</dfn>
‘the splendor of God,’ is ever with him. Bahman
<a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 222</span>
(who is the same as Jabriîl) has borne Zardusht to
the presence of the Almighty; and God having
imparted to him the knowledge of all the secrets
of existence, sends him forth as a prophet. A just
sovereign will co-operate with him in promulgating
his faith, and every vestige of enchanters
and Deeves shall be cut off from the earth.”
The father of Zardusht said one day to <span class="person">Partarúsh</span>:
“Give me some account of Zardusht’s star and its
rise; tell me also why he laughed at the time of
his birth”. <span class="person">Partarúsh</span> replied: “Thy son Zardusht
is to be a chief, as all the happy spheres afford
him aid; this offspring of auspicious career will
conduct the creatures of God in the true way;
promulgate the <span class="title">Zandavasta</span>;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_391" id="fnanchor_391"></a><a href="#footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a></span>
destroy the demon
<a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 223</span>
and enchanters, and finally king Gushtasp shall
embrace his faith.” This announcement gave
great delight to Purshasp.</p>

<p><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 224</span>
At this time there lived an aged saint named <span class="person">Barzinkaroos</span>,
of profound experience and clear discernment;
this sage having come to the house of Purshasp,
<a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 225</span>
entreated that he might be allowed to bring
up Zardusht, and acquire glory by his education.
Purshasp consented to this proposal, and entrusted
the infant to the holy sage.</p>

<p><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 226</span>
When Zardusht had attained his seventh year,
Purtarush, the chief of the magicians, came along
with Duransanun to the child’s abode; and made
<a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 227</span>
so great a display of enchantments, terrific, and
fearful sights, that all the people fled out of the
house; but Zardusht, through the aid of God,
felt no alarm and moved not, so that the magicians
went away filled with affright and disappointment.
After some time Zardusht became ill, at which news
all the magicians were greatly delighted; their chief
Partarósh came, with enchantments and medicine
mixed up with <dfn>mina</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_392" id="fnanchor_392"></a><a href="#footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a></span>
to Zardusht’s pillow and said:
“The swallowing of this medicine will render thy
body tranquil and deliver thee from pain.” The
illuminated mind of Zardusht saw through the machination,
and taking the medicine from him, poured
it on the ground, and at the same time telling him
about the <dfn>mina</dfn> mixed up with the portion, said:</p>

 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p class="unindent">The magicians consequently again returned back
mortified at the results of their wicked plot. They
say that in those times they accounted no system
superior to that of magic, and that the demon held
public intercourse with persons of that class so that
they obtained it from Iblis without the intervention
of enchantment.</p>

Nay, Purshásp, the father of Zardusht, followed that
path; one day having invited Duránsarún, Párántárúsh,
and many more magicians to a feast, he made
the suitable arrangements, and when the repast was
ended, he said to Párántárúsh, the chief of the magicians:
“Through the excellence of enchantment,
whereby our hearts are gladdened and our necks
exalted, thy noble person at this period is the
spiritual guide of all magicians.” Zardusht, being
indignant at this speech, said to his father:
“Abandon this erroneous way, and turn to the faith
of God: hell must finally be the abode of magicians
and enchanters.” These words greatly
incensed Purtarúsh, who replied: “Of what consequence
art thou before thy father! The intelligent
of the earth, and the great men of the habitable
world dare not address such insolence to me!
Art thou not afraid of me? Dost thou not know
me? For this thy insolence I shall spread amongst
mankind such calumnies and lies respecting thy
creed, that thou must remain in obscurity. What
is thy power that, without courtesy, thou darest
slight my dignity!</p>

<p class="unindent">Zardusht replied: “O son of earth! the lie thou
utterest respecting my creed will render thyself
before God and man the butt of censure: in retaliation
<a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 229</span>

<p class="unindent">All who were present, as well as the magicians,
remained in astonishment at such a stripling’s great
intellect, so that Párántárúsh left the house and hastened
home, covered with confusion and disgrace:
that night he fell sick, and his people also being
attacked by illness at the same time, were hurried
along with him to the house of
retribution.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_393" id="fnanchor_393"></a><a href="#footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a></span></p>

<p>When the honored age of Zardusht had reached
the fifteenth year, he attached not his heart to this
place of sojourn, neither did he set any value on the
world or its concerns: but fleeing away from wrath
and the pleasures of sense, he with pious fear labored
night and day in the service of God; wherever
he found any one hungry, thirsty, naked, or helpless,
he bestowed on them food, raiment, and the
needful supplies; his piety and sincerity were consequently
renowned amongst all people, although he
withdrew from the public gaze.</p>

<p>When he had reached the age of thirty, he directed
his face towards Iran, in company with several men
<a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 230</span>
and women and some of his own relations; in the
course of this journey, they came to a large expanse
of water, on which there was not a boat to be
found:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_394" id="fnanchor_394"></a><a href="#footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a></span>
as it is not meet for women to expose their persons,
particularly before strangers, he became anxious
about the means of taking them over in the presence
of their fellow travellers; he therefore poured
out his distress before the God of justice, entreating
from him a passage over that wide expanse of water;
after which, by the order of the Almighty, he crossed
over, with his companions and relations, in such
guise that the soles of their feet only were moistened
by the water; finally, in the end of
<span class="time">Isfandarmaz</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_395" id="fnanchor_395"></a><a href="#footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a></span> on
the day of <span class="time">Anírán</span>, which is the last day of every
solar month, he reached the confines of Iran. At
that period the people of Iran held a great festival
at which were assembled both high and low, and
therefore Zartusht took his course to that quarter.
At night, whilst alone in some halting place, through
his enlightened spirit he beheld, in a vision, a mighty
army<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_396" id="fnanchor_396"></a><a href="#footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a></span>
advancing from Bactria, or the West, which
from hostile motives blocked up his road on every
side; in the same place he beheld another army
coming from <dfn>Nimroz</dfn>, or “mid day,” and when both
<a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 231</span>
armies came to close quarters with the sword, the
Bactrian or Western troops were put to the rout.
The examiner of the vision thus interpreted it:
“When Zardusht, having been taken into the presence
of God, should discover all the mysteries of
creation, that afterwards, on his return from
heaven, to promulgate the <dfn>Dínbahí</dfn>, or ‘true
faith,’ the Dîvs and Magicians, having found
out his intentions, would with all expedition make
war against him.
<span class="title">Mizumah</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_397" id="fnanchor_397"></a><a href="#footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a></span>
the angel who attends
the servants of God, on learning this will promote
the better faith, and in consequence the <span class="title">Asta va
zand</span> will be read with a loud voice, and through
this the demons and magicians shall be dispersed
and flee away.” On the interpretation of the
dream, he hastened to the festival, inspired with
great delight.</p>

<p>When he had returned from the banqueting-place,
he set out about the middle of
<span class="time">Ardíbihist</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_398" id="fnanchor_398"></a><a href="#footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a></span> on
the <span class="time">Dímihr</span>, the fifteenth day of every solar month,
and came to a deep, broad, and extensive water,
named <span class="title">Dábatí</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_399" id="fnanchor_399"></a><a href="#footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a></span>
in the <span class="place">Astawasta</span>; there recommending
<a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 232</span>
himself to the Lord, he stepped into the water, which
at first rose up to the calf of his legs, then to his
knees, waist, and finally to his neck; which event
was thus interpreted; “the division of the water
into these four portions signifies, that in nine
thousand years the <span class="title">Dínbahí</span>, ‘the true faith,’ shall
be four times renewed; the first time by the agency
of Zardusht, who was sent to promulgate the <span class="person">Bahdín</span>;
the second by <span class="person">Hushídar</span>; the third by <span class="person">Hushídarmáh</span>;
and the fourth by <span class="person">Sarsásh</span>; all four descendants
from Zardusht.”</p>

<p>When the prophet had gained the opposite shore,
he washed his person as pure as his soul, and putting
on undefiled garments, engaged in
prayer.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_400" id="fnanchor_400"></a><a href="#footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a></span>
That very day, Bahman, the mightiest of the angels,
(whom the Muhammedans call Jabriel) came robed
in light to Zardusht, and having asked his name,
<a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 233</span>
said: “What dost thou most desire in this world?”
Zardusht having answered, “I have no desire but
that of pleasing God; my heart seeks after nothing
but righteousness; and my belief is that thou wilt
guide me to do what is good:” then Bahram replied
“Arise! that thou mayest appear before
God; entreat from his Majesty whatever thou
desirest, from his bounty he will return thee a
profitable answer.” Zardusht then arose, and
according to Bahram’s order shut his eyes for an
instant; on opening them he found himself in the
bright empyreal, where he beheld an assemblage
through whose effulgence his shadow became visible:
from that assemblage to the next, was a distance of
twenty-four paces; and also another assemblage of
beings formed of light waited on by virgins of paradise.
The angels gathered around Zardusht and
warmly greeted him, pointing him out to each other,
until the honored son of
Espintaman<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_401" id="fnanchor_401"></a><a href="#footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a></span>
came before
God, to whom with joyous heart and trembling
body he addressed the prayers of supplication. It
is necessary to observe here, that the <span class="title">Báhidínian</span>,
“believers of the eternal doctrine,” unanimously
maintain that Bahman assumed the human figure,
and that Zardusht ascended to the heavens in his
<a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 234</span>
elemental body; but, according to the creed of the
intelligent Abádián, the matter is thus stated: “By
the coming of Bahman in the human form and
his speaking like a mortal, is meant that the true
essence of man is uncompounded and simple, not
a body nor any thing material; and that, under
such a quality, that is, uncompoundedness, he
manifested himself to Zardusht; and his saying
‘close thy eyes,’ is figurative, and implies the
eradication of the attachments and darkness of
the elemental body; when he thus became a simple
uncompounded existence, he arrived at the
heavens styled the ‘eternal empyrean;’ the first
company of angels signifies the souls on high,
and the second, the existence of the celestial intelligences;
the interrogatories addressed to him by
the angels imply, that when the soul leaves the
upper world, it descends into this lower abode to
encounter wanderings and calamity; but when,
by the attractive influence of Bahman and through
the energy of intelligence, it returns on high, the
angels feel delight on the occasion. He next
ascended to the world of simple uncompounded
beings, and came near God; the delight experienced
by Zardusht signifies, the freedom from
alarm and fear enjoyed in that pure world; and
his bodily tremor is emblematic of the effulgence
of the divine Majesty.” He then asked of the God of
<a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 235</span>
justice: “Which of thy servants on earth is superior
to the rest?” God thus answered: “The righteous
professor of righteousness; secondly, he who
to righteousness joins generosity and liberality,
walking unceasingly in the way of righteousness
and withdrawing from evil; thirdly, he who is
friendly to fire and water, to all living and animated
beings; for man, by the knowledge and
practice of this precept, delivers himself from hell
and attains to union with the eternal paradise.
O, Zardusht! whichever of my servants in this
transitory sojourn of existence practises oppression
and cruelty towards my creatures, and averts
his head from obedience to my commands, repeat
thou to such this warning: that unless he desist
from rebellion, he shall dwell in hell to all eternity.”
Zardusht again asked: “O most just God,
impart to me the names of the
<span class="title">Amshásfands</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_402" id="fnanchor_402"></a><a href="#footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a></span> that
is, of the angels the most acceptable in thy presence;
gladden me by their names and sight;
cause me to hear their discourse; and graciously
enable me to discern the impious
Ahriman,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_403" id="fnanchor_403"></a><a href="#footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a></span> who
<a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 236</span>
turns not to good through his evil nature; give
me power to behold the good and evil of this
world, and its termination; the effect of the
revolving sphere, with the successive production
of modes or the reappearance of things.” When
he had thus laid before the Almighty the secret
wishes of his heart, he received this answer: “I am
<a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 237</span>
the author of good; the benevolent and the beneficent;
I neither do evil, nor enjoin it to be committed.
I consent not to wickedness, neither do
I bring calamity on my creatures: evil and wickedness
belong exclusively to Ahriman. It is,
however, incumbent on me to keep in hell to all
eternity the troops of Ahriman in reward for
their deeds: the ignorant only assert that I am the
“author of evil.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_404" id="fnanchor_404"></a><a href="#footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a></span>
The Almighty then made Zardusht
acquainted with the celestial revolutions and
the motions of the stars, and their good and evil
influences; he also showed him paradise filled with
light, angelic nymphs, palaces, and <span class="title">Amshásfands</span>;
communicating to him at the same time the knowledge
of all mysteries, and teaching him all sciences,
so that he knew every thing from the commencement
of existence to the end of time; he likewise
showed him Ahriman in the gloom of hell, who, on
beholding Zardusht cried aloud: “Turn away from
the faith of God, that thou mayest obtain all thy
desires in this
world.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_405" id="fnanchor_405"></a><a href="#footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 238</span>
When the Lord had thus instructed Zardusht, he
beheld a mountain of flaming fire, which at the command
of God he traversed without any injury to his
person; they next poured molten brass on his guileless,
silver-like bosom, and not a single hair of his
body was touched; they next opened his stomach,
and taking out all the intestines again replaced
them, on which the wound immediately closed
without leaving a vestige of the incision behind.
The just God then said to Zardusht: “Thou hast
passed over the mountain of fire, and hadst thy
stomach rent open; therefore tell mankind whoever
turns away from the <span class="title">Dínbahí</span>, ‘pure faith,’
and passes over to Ahriman, in the same manner
shall the blood of his body be poured out; he
shall dwell in the fire, and never attain to the joys
of paradise. Again, the molten brass, which on
contact with thy breast became congealed like ice,
causing thee no injury, is a sign that the nation,
at the suggestion of Ahriman, will turn away from
the faith; and also that when the <span class="title">Dínbahí</span> shall be
promulgated in the world, the high Mobed shall
gird his loins to give them battle.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“The heart of mankind was harassed with doubt,</div>
  <div class="i0">However thou knowest this brass was but a sign;</div>
  <div class="i0">It is therefore meet that Azarbád, the son of Márasfand,</div>
  <div class="i0">Should impart to each individual counsel of every kind;</div>
  <div class="i0">This molten brass he should pour on his breast,</div>
  <div class="i0">From which no injury shall result to him.</div>
 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p class="unindent"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 239</span>
“So that, on beholding this miracle, all mankind
with heart and soul will follow the right true
road.”</p>

<p>After this, Zardusht asked of the God of justice:
“In what manner shall thy worshippers celebrate
thy praise and what is to be their Kiblah?” The
Lord answered: “Tell all mankind that every bright
and luminous object is the effulgence of my light;
at the time of worshipping me, let them turn to
that side, in order that Ahriman may flee from
them; in the world there is no existence superior
to light, out of which I have created paradise, the
angelic nymphs, and all that is pleasant, whilst
hell was produced out of darkness.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">

  <div class="i0">Dost thou not perceive that either place is formed out of my light?”</div>
 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>Having thus taught Zardusht the <span class="title">Avesta</span> and the
<span class="title">Zand</span>, he said to him: “Recite this celebrated volume
to king Gushtasp, that through it he may
obtain wisdom; tell him also to attain a perfect
knowledge of me; no one should ever call me the
worker of injustice; command the Mobeds and all
mankind to separate themselves from demons and
magicians.”</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“Zardusht then enlarged on the praises of the Almighty Lord.”</div>
 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>When the prophet’s desires and purpose had been
thus completely attained, he was met on his return
<a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 240</span>
by the Amshásfand Bahman, the protector and chief
of the sheep, who said to him: “To thee I deliver
the sheep and all herds; tell the Mobeds, sages,
and all men to guard them well; prohibit them
from putting to death calf, lamb, young sheep,
or any other quadruped, as men derive great benefits
from them:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“We must never be guilty of excess in slaughter.”</div>
 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>“I received these flocks from the Almighty, and
now accept them from me; account not my words
as unimportant, but inculcate obedience to them
on young and old:” on which Zardusht accepted
the trust. The Mobed Sarush used to say: “The
Yezdanians maintain that, when Bahman forbade
the killing of young quadrupeds, he well knew it
to be equally wrong to slay the old; first, because
in their youth, although they rendered many services,
they received no wages for their labor; and
secondly, in old age they produce young animals;
consequently, where Zardusht in some passages
holds it lawful to slay animals, but without committing
excess; by the precept is meant, the expulsion
of animal qualities from our existence; and
by avoiding excess is meant, that we should gradually
banish all vile propensities from ourselves,
such as eating to excess, which is an animal quality,
but which cannot be discontinued at once; it
<a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 241</span>
therefore becomes necessary to lessen the quantity
of food gradually, as stated by us under the head
of the <span class="title">Sáhí Keshán</span>.”</p>

<p>After Bahman, the Amshásfand
<span class="person">Ardebihist</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_406" id="fnanchor_406"></a><a href="#footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a></span> coming
forward, said to Zardusht: “O accepted of God!
bear from me this message to king Gushtasp, and
say to him: ‘To thee have I delivered whatever
relates to fire. Let there be suitable places of
great splendor in every city for the general worship;
appoint stated times and <dfn>Hirbuds</dfn>, or ‘ministers’
for the purpose of adoration; because
that light is an emanation of the divine effulgence.
Dost thou not perceive how every thing
stands in need of fire, which requires only wood
from the human race?’</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“Its body apprehends not death nor the decrepitude of age,</div>

<p>“Such is its property to indicate the truth, that
if thou burn perfumes it diffuses fragrance among
the assembled people: from unpleasant odors a
correspondent effect ensues; it also banishes the
affliction of cold. As fully as God hath delivered
it to me, do I now give it in charge to thee! Whoever
<a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 242</span>
turns away from my counsel and advice becomes
the captive of hell, and incurs the displeasure
of God.”</p>

<p>When Zardusht had departed from Bahman, the
Amshásfand <span class="person">Shahrivar</span> came forward and said to him:
“On thy arrival from the upper to the lower world,
tell men to furbish and polish up their arms, and
always to keep them in good order and readiness;
in the day of battle let them not quit their posts,
but display heroic exertion and not resign their
post to any other.”</p>

<p><span class="person">Asfandármaz</span> then coming forward, after many
benedictions said to Zardusht: “This is the command
of the Almighty to mankind, let them keep
the earth pure, and remove blood, pollution, and
dead bodies to some uncultivated place.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“Among princes, that sovereign is by far the best</div>

 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>When Zardusht had departed thence, <span class="person">Khúrdád</span>
advanced, and with benedictions thus addressed
him: “To thy charge I assign all waters of running
streams, rivers, water-courses, rivulets, wells,
and all besides; say thou to mankind:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“Through water is the body of every creature maintained in life;</div>

<p class="unindent">“Let them keep dead bodies far removed from it,

carcass, as the food dressed with such water furnishes
an unwholesome repast.”</p>

<p><span class="person">Murdád</span> next came forward and said to Zardusht:
“Let not men heedlessly destroy the vegetable productions
of the earth or pluck them from their
place:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“As these form the delight of both man and beast.</div>

</div><!--end poem-->

<p class="unindent">“Also, O prophet of God! send Mobeds around the
whole country, and appoint a wise person in
every city to communicate these tidings to all men:
let them understand the <span class="title">Avesta</span>, and bind around

faith and constancy in it, and let them endeavor to

 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>It is to be remembered that the conference of all
these angels with Zardusht was a revelation and
message from God; but there was a more transcendent
dignity in this fact, that the Almighty himself
addressed Zardusht without the intervention of
angels, and imparted to him the mysteries of all
that exists.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_407" id="fnanchor_407"></a><a href="#footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 244</span>
Zardusht having thus obtained from God the accurate
knowledge of all mysteries, drew near this elemental
world, whilst the magicians and demons,
with a dreadful host, blocked up his road; after
which the chief enchanter and the head of the demons
and his host thus addressed Zardusht: “Keep
the <span class="title">Avesta</span> and <span class="title">Zand</span> concealed; thy incantation,
fraud, and artifice make no impression on us: if
thou knowest us, thou wilt turn away from such
practices.” On hearing this, Zardusht recited
aloud one chapter of the <span class="title">Avesta</span> and <span class="title">Zand</span>; when
these sounds reached the demons, they hid themselves
under ground, and the magicians trembled;
a part of the enchanters died on the spot, and the
remainder implored for mercy.</p>

<p>The Mobed <span class="person">Surúsh</span>, the Yezdánian, has been heard
to say: “It is recorded in the treatise of <span class="title">Míhín Farúsh</span>
that, according to the doctors of the pure faith,
when Zardusht had thus obtained the victory over
the demons, and was proceeding to an interview
with the great king Gushtasp, there happened to be
two oppressive and infidel kings in his road; these
Zardusht invited to adopt the pure faith and turn
away from their evil practices; but they heeded not
<a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 245</span>
his words, he therefore prayed to God, and there
began to blow a mighty wind, which lifted up these
two kings on high and kept them suspended in the
air; the people who came around were astonished
on beholding this sight; the birds also from every
quarter of the sky flocked around the two kings, and
with beaks and talons tore off their flesh until their
bones fell to the
ground.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_408" id="fnanchor_408"></a><a href="#footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a></span></p>

<p>Zaratusht, the son of Bahram, says, that when
Zardusht after his victory arrived at the court of
the great king Gushtasp, he called on the name
God, and then sought access to the
sovereign.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_409" id="fnanchor_409"></a><a href="#footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a></span> He
beheld the first rank, composed of the grandees and
champions of Iran and other regions, standing
around; and above these two ranks of sages, philosophers,
and learned men, who took precedence of
each other in proportion to their knowledge, for this
great king was exceedingly attached to men of science;
he next beheld the monarch of the world
seated on a lofty throne, and his brows encircled
with a costly crown: on which Zardusht in eloquent
language recited the praises of the king.</p>

<p>Farzánah Bahram, the son of Farhad, of the Yazdanian
<a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 246</span>
sect, relates thus in the <cite>Sháristán</cite>: “The doctors
of the pure faith say, that when Zardusht
entered into king Gushtasp’s assembly, he held
in his hand a blazing fire which caused him no
injury; he then transferred that fire to the
king’s hands, which in like manner remained
unhurt; he afterwards gave it into the hands of
others and still no trace of burning appeared; he
next lay down, and ordered molten brass to be
poured on his bosom four different times: although
the molten metal came on his breast, no
bodily injury resulted from
it.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_410" id="fnanchor_410"></a><a href="#footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a></span>
Zaratusht, the
son of Bahram, adds: The sovereign of Iran having
thus ascertained the dignity of the prophet of the
human race, addressed him with terms of earnest
affection, and ordering a chair to be brought, placed
him in front of the royal throne, above the two
ranks of the philosophers. Zardusht, agreeably to
the king’s command, having taken this seat, manifested
to all the assembly the precious diamonds of
his intellectual stores. The sages and eminent men
of the exterior circles on his right and left entered
on the path of controversy, but were finally refuted,
<a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 247</span>
one after another. They say that on this day thirty
of the sages seated on his right, being unable to withstand
the arguments of Zardusht, bore testimony to
his knowledge and truth; and in like manner thirty
of the wise men on his left were overpowered and
convinced. When such sages, who had not their
equals in the seven climates, had been thus confuted,
the illustrious prince called the prophet of the Lord
into his presence, and for further conviction questioned
him on various sciences and the traditions of
old; and having received conclusive answers on all
these points he was struck with amazement. The
great king therefore assigned to the prophet of the
just Lord a dwelling adjacent to his own palace,
and the philosophers departed home with afflicted
hearts. During the whole night they read over
books with each other, and concerted with each other
how they might, the following morning, conduct the
argument and controversy with Zardusht; whilst
the prophet of the Lord on coming to his house,
according to his custom, desisted not until morning
from acts of worship and praise. The following
day, when Zardusht and the philosophers assembled
around the king, whatever the sages advanced
which was not strictly conformable to truth, Zardusht
produced a hundred arguments, both theoretical
and practical, to invalidate the assertion;
and if they demanded a proof of whatever he himself
<a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 248</span>
advanced, he adduced a hundred convincing
demonstrations. Gushtasp accordingly increased
the dignity of the Lord’s prophet, and inquired his
name, lineage, and native city; to which questions
Zardusht returned the meet answer, and said: “O
great king, to-morrow is the day of Hormuz, or
the first of the month; command the chiefs of the
military to assemble and all the philosophers to
appear, that I may reduce all to silence, as I have
done this assembly, and give answers which will
dumbfound them; after which I shall execute the
commission with which I am entrusted.”</p>

<p>Gushtasp issued the requisite order, and they all
returned home with this agreement. Zardusht,
from inclination and habit, continued in supplication
to the Lord; and the wise men said to each other:
“This stranger has twice degraded us wise men,
taken away our reputation, and obtained favor
with the king:” they therefore conferred with
each other how they could most effectually oppose
Zardusht and refute his arguments.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“With this understanding each retired to his own abode,</div>
  <div class="i0">And through anxiety not one of them slept all that night.”</div>
 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p class="unindent">On the third day, the nobles, doctors, and wise men
assembled around the king, and Zardusht also advanced
into the company: although the sages and
learned men had mutually combined to confound
him by argument, they were all finally refuted.
<a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 249</span>
When the philosophers were no longer able to utter
a word, the superior personages gave place to Zardusht,
on which the prophet of the Lord loosed his
tongue and said to Gushtasp: “I am the envoy of
the Lord the Creator of the heavens, earth, and
stars; the disinterested bestower of daily food to
his servant: he who has brought thee from non-existence
into being and made kings thy servants,
has sent me to thee.” Then taking the <span class="title">Avesta</span>
and <span class="title">Zand</span> out of a case, he added: “This volume
God has given to me, and sent me forth to the
human race with the commandments named
<span class="title">Astawazand</span>, which require implicit obedience; if
thou wilt conform to the commands of God, in
like manner as he has made thee sovereign of the
world, he will also make thee eternally happy in
futurity and paradise; but if thou avert the head
from his command, thou incurrest the displeasure
of the just God; the foundation of thy greatness
shall be rent, and thou shalt finally become a
denizen of hell.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“Adopt no line of conduct through the suggestion of a Div.</div>
  <div class="i0">From this time forward listen to my commands.”</div>
 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p class="unindent">The great king replied: “What proof dost thou
adduce, and what miracle dost thou perform?
exhibit them, that I may instantly diffuse thy
faith over all the world.” Zardusht said: “One
of my decisive proofs and miraculous works is
<a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 250</span>
this volume, on once listening to which thou
shalt never more behold demon or magician: this
volume contains the mysteries of both worlds,
and clearly expounds the revolutions of the stars:
there is no being in existence an account of which
is not found in this book.” The king then
commanded: “Read me a section of this heavenly
volume.” Zardusht having read one chapter,
Gushtasp not feeling a full conviction, said to him:
“Thou hast urged a bold suit; but precipitancy in
such an affair is by no means proper; I shall
devote some days to exploring the nature of the
<span class="title">Zand-Avesta</span>: but in the mean time come thou hither
as usual.” Zardusht then</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“Returned to the house assigned him by the king.”</div>
 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>The enraged philosophers also came out and took
counsel with each other about slaying Zardusht.
The following morning, when Zardusht left the
house to go to the king’s palace, he delivered the
key of his apartment to the king’s porter; but the
philosophers so deluded this man, that he gave up
the key secretly to them; on which they opened the
door of the prophet’s apartment, and having put
into bags unclean things which they had collected,
such as blood, hair, a cat’s head, a dog’s head, dead
men’s bones and the like, placed them under his
pillow, and having locked the door, gave the key
back to the porter, previously obliging him to swear
<a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 251</span>
to keep the matter altogether secret; after this they
went to the palace, where they beheld Zardusht
seated near the king, who was engaged in reading
the <span class="title">Zand-Avesta</span>,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“Lost in amazement at the characters and words.”</div>
 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>The philosophers said: “The <span class="title">Zand-Avesta</span> is altogether
magic, and this man is a wizard, who by
force of spells has produced an impression on thy
heart, in order to bring evil and confusion all
over the world; but be not thou the wizard’s
ally.” On hearing this, Gushtasp ordered persons
to repair to Zardusht’s house and make a
careful examination; they went and immediately
brought before the king whatever they found in the
house, whether eatables, carpets, dresses, clothes-bags,
etc., all which they opened in the king’s presence;
on this, the talons, hair, and such like impurities,
which had been hidden there by the philosophers,
were exposed to view. The king was
greatly enraged, and said to Zardusht: “This is thy
magic practice.” The prophet of the Lord being
quite astonished, replied: “I have no knowledge of
these things; let his majesty inquire the particulars
from the porter.” The porter on being summoned,
said: “Zardusht closed his door, and not
even wind had access to it.” The king became
quite indignant and said to Zardusht: “They have
not brought these sacks from heaven and hid them
<a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 252</span>
under the pillow.” In his rage he threw away
the <span class="title">Avesta-Zand</span>, and sent Zardusht in chains to
prison: there was also a porter appointed to give
him a fixed allowance and keep strict watch. Zardusht
remained in chains both day and night, the
porter bringing him daily a loaf of bread and a
pitcher of water; and one whole week passed in that
manner.</p>

<p>They relate that Gushtasp had a royal steed called
the “Black Charger,” which the great king mounted
on the day of battle:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“When, mounted on this charger’s back, he advanced to the fight,</div>
  <div class="i2">The result of the combat terminated in victory.”</div>
 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p class="unindent">One morning at dawn, the master of the horse
beheld the Black Charger without fore or hind feet,
which he saw were drawn up into his belly; in great
haste he announced this event to the sovereign of
the world. Gushtasp in great affliction hurried to
the stable, summoning thither the veterinary surgeons,
physicians, and learned men, all of whom
exerted themselves in remedies and applications
without any benefit resulting from their exertions.
Through grief the king partook not of food that
day, and the military were sorely afflicted. Zardusht,
who in consequence of the general mourning
had not received his allowance before evening,
became hungry; when the evening had passed, the
porter came and brought the provisions, stating at
<a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 253</span>
the same time what had befallen the Black Charger;
on this the prophet of the Lord said to him: “To-morrow
tell the king that I can set this affair to
rights.” The next morning the porter conveyed
the prophet’s message to the king, on which orders
were given to bring Zardusht into the royal presence.
This favorable intelligence having been
communicated to Zardusht, the prophet entered into
a warm bath, and after ablution, on appearing before
the king, he uttered benedictions on the sovereign
of the world. Gushtasp then assigned him a place
near himself, and having explained the state of the
horse, added:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“If thou be truly a prophet sent from the Lord,</div>
  <div class="i0">Thou canst easily restore this horse to perfect health.”</div>
 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p class="unindent">Zardusht replied: “If thou wilt, O king, engage to
perform four things, thou shalt again behold the
charger’s fore and hind legs.” The king said:
“I accept the conditions: what is the first?” Zardusht
replied: “Let us all repair to the Black
Charger’s bed.” On arriving there he said to the
king: “Make thy heart and tongue of one accord:
utter with thy tongue and repeat with thy heart,
that without doubt, suspicion, or equivocation, I
am a prophet and apostle sent from God.” The
king having agreed to this, the prophet of the Lord
addressed his petitions to the God of justice, and
then rubbing with his hand the horse’s right forefoot,
<a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 254</span>
it straightway came out, on which the king and
the soldiery loudly applauded the holy man.</p>

<p>After this, he said to the king: “Command the
heroic Isfendiar to enter into a covenant with me
that he will gird up his loins to promulgate the
faith of the Lord.” The prince was not averse,
and entered into a solemn engagement; on which
the apostle prayed to the Lord until the right hind
leg came out.</p>

<p>He then said to the great king: “Send an <span class="title">Ustawar</span>
and an <span class="title">Amin</span> along with me to the great queen
<span class="person">Kitábún</span>, in order that she may enter into the true
faith.” The king having assented, Zardusht on
coming into the king’s golden apartment thus addressed
queen Kitábún: “Mighty princess! the Lord
has expressly selected thee to share the couch of
Gushtasp and to be the mother of Isfendiar. I am
the Lord’s prophet sent by him to the king:
therefore adopt the pure faith.” On this the
great queen with heart and soul attached herself in
sincerity to the prophet: after which Zardusht
prayed, so that the other hind leg came out.</p>

<p>He then said to the king: “Now send for the
porter; it is proper to inquire of him who it was
that conveyed this stuff of magical preparation to
my house.” The king summoned the chamberlain
and questioned him in a threatening tone, saying:
“If thou wilt confess the truth, thou savest
<a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 255</span>
thy life; but otherwise, thou shalt have thy head
under thy feet.” The treacherous chamberlain
implored pardon, and related all the particulars of
the bribery and delusion practised by the philosophers’
friends. Gushtasp was exceedingly indignant,
and ordered the four philosophers to be
hanged. Zardusht then recited the prayers taught
him by the Almighty, so that the other forefoot
came out, and the swift charger stood on his legs.
The sovereign of Iran kissed the prophet’s head and
face, and leading him to the throne, seated him near
himself; he also requested pardon for his sin and
gave back the prophet’s
goods.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_411" id="fnanchor_411"></a><a href="#footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a></span></p>

<p>The doctors of the pure faith also record, that
king <span class="person">Lohrasp</span> and
<span class="person">Zerir</span>, brother to Gushtasp having
fallen into so violent a malady, that the physicians
in despair desisted from all attendance on
them, but having been restored to health through
the prayers of Zardusht, they adopted the pure
faith.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_412" id="fnanchor_412"></a><a href="#footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a></span></p>

<p>Zaratusht the son of Bahram relates: One day
<a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 256</span>
Zardusht, having come into the king’s presence, he
thus addressed the prophet of the Lord: “I desire
to obtain four things from God; it is therefore
meet that the prophet should request them:
first, that I should behold my own state in the
next world; secondly, that in the time of conflict
no blow should make any impression on me, so
that I may be able to diffuse the true faith;
thirdly, that I may know thoroughly the mysteries
of good and evil in this world; fourthly, that
until the day of judgment my spirit may remain
united to my body.” Zardusht replied: “I will
entreat the Lord to grant these four wishes:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“But it is necessary that out of these four wishes</div>
  <div class="i0">Thou shouldst implore one only for thyself:</div>
  <div class="i0">Choose three wishes for three different persons:</div>
  <div class="i0">That I may entreat them from the righteous Creator;</div>
  <div class="i0">He will not confer on any one person these four gifts,</div>
  <div class="i0">Because that person might say: ‘I am the supreme Creator.’”</div>
 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>The king having agreed to this, Zaratusht at the
time of evening prayer went to his house, repeated
the praises of the Almighty, entreating from him the
accomplishment of the king’s desires, and lay down
in the act of adoration: in this state God showed him
in a vision that the king’s petition was granted. At
dawn of day the king was seated on his throne;
Zardusht appeared in the royal presence and came
to his place; in a moment after, the king’s chamberlain
entering in great trepidation, said: “There are
<a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 257</span>
four terror-striking, awe-inspiring horsemen at
the door:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“Never before have I beheld horsemen of such a kind.”</div>
 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p class="unindent">The king asked of Zardusht: “Who are these persons?”
but he had scarcely done speaking before
all the four horsemen dressed in green, completely
armed, of majestic port, drew near the throne; these
four cavaliers were of the number of those angels
who are nearest the just God, and are of the great
Amshasfands, namely,
<span class="person">Bahman</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_413" id="fnanchor_413"></a><a href="#footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a></span>
<span class="person">Ardibahist</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_414" id="fnanchor_414"></a><a href="#footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a></span>
<span class="person">Azarkhurdad</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_415" id="fnanchor_415"></a><a href="#footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></span>
and <span class="person">Azargushtásp</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_416" id="fnanchor_416"></a><a href="#footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a></span>
who thus addressed the
king: “We are angels and the envoys of God. The
Dispenser of justice thus declares: ‘Zardusht is
my prophet, whom I have sent to all the inhabitants
of the earth; attend well to him; if thou
devote thyself to his way, thou art delivered
from hell. Never inflict pain on him; and
when thou obtainest thy desires, avert not thy
head from his commands.’”</p>

<p>King Gushtasp, although in magnanimity immovable
as mount <span class="place">Alburz</span>, yet through the majesty
<a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 258</span>
of the angels and their awful presence, fell senseless
from his throne: on recovering himself he thus
addressed the righteous Lord:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“I am the lowest of all thy servants,</div>
  <div class="i0">And have girt up my loins to execute thy orders.”</div>
 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>When the Amshásfands heard this answer, they
departed; and the military, on learning this wonderful
occurrence, were all assembled: the king also,
trembling all over, apologized to Zardusht:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“Thy command sits upon my soul;</div>
  <div class="i0">My spirit is like the son of the Lord;</div>
  <div class="i0">My body, soul, and wealth are all to thee devoted,</div>
  <div class="i0">By order of the just and glorious Creator.”</div>
 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>The prophet of the Lord replied: “May good
tidings ever attend thee! I have entreated from
the Almighty the completion of thy desires, and
my prayer has been granted.” Zardusht then
ordered that for the purpose of the
<dfn>Yashtan-i-darún</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_417" id="fnanchor_417"></a><a href="#footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a></span>
that is, “the recitation and breathing out of
prayer,” they should make ready in an inner
<a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 259</span>
apartment wine, sweet perfumes, milk, and a pomegranate;
and over these he performed <dfn>Yasht</dfn>, or “the
recitation of prayers,” in a low voice, out of the
<span class="title">Avesta</span> and <span class="title">Zand</span>; after this ceremony they gave
Gushtasp some of the hallowed wine, on the mere
tasting of which he became insensible and rose not
up for three days: in that interval his spirit ascended
to heaven, and there beheld the celestial nymphs,
their palaces, progeny, and attendants; the blessings
of paradise; the different gradations of rank among
the virtuous, and the grade reserved for himself.</p>

<p>The prophet next presented to
<span class="person">Bishutan</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_418" id="fnanchor_418"></a><a href="#footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a></span> some of
that hallowed milk, on drinking of which he was
delivered from the pangs of death and obtained eternal
life. Some of the Yezdánian doctors hold, that
by eternal life is implied the knowledge of one’s own
essence and soul, which never admit of decay; milk
is also mentioned, as it constitutes the food of children,
and science is the food of spirit; on which
account they have likened science to consecrated
milk. He next gave
<span class="person">Jamasp</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_419" id="fnanchor_419"></a><a href="#footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a></span>
some of the hallowed
perfume, through the efficacy of which universal
science shed its lustre on his heart; so that, from
that very day of his existence, whatever was to come
to pass until the day of judgment was clearly comprehended
<a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 260</span>
by him in all its details. He then gave
one grain of the hallowed pomegranate to <span class="person">Isfendiar</span>,
who on eating it instantly became brazen-bodied,
and his frame grew so hard that no blow could make
an impression on it.</p>

<p>When the great king awoke from his vision, he
broke out into praise and adoration; after which he
called for Zardusht, to whom he related what he had
witnessed, and commanded all men to receive the
pure faith; then, being seated on his throne, he
ordered the prophet of the Lord to recite some sections
of the <span class="title">Zand</span> in his presence. On hearing the
<span class="title">Avesta</span>, the demons fled and concealed themselves
under the earth. The great king next commanded
that in every city the Mobeds should attend to the
observance of fire, erecting domes over it, and keeping
stated festivals and times.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Account of the precepts given by Zardusht to
the king and to all mankind.</span>&mdash;The prophet Zardusht,
having read to the king some sections concerning
the greatness and majesty of the Almighty,
said to him: “As thou hast adopted the ways of
God, the joy of paradise is to be thy portion; but
he who abandons that way is hurried off to hell
by Ahriman, who feels delighted, and on making
the capture says to his victim: ‘Because thou
hast abandoned the ways of God, therefore art
<a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 261</span>
thou fallen into hell.’ But the just God is liberal
to his servants, and has sent me to them,
saying: ‘Communicate my covenant to all created
beings, that they may abandon their perverse
ways.’ I am his prophet, sent to thee that thou
mayst guide mankind to the right road; as the
final result of persevering in the way of God is the
attainment of paradise; and the retribution of
devotedness to Ahriman is hell. He moreover
commanded me: ‘Say thou to mankind, if ye
adopt the pure faith, then shall paradise be your
place; but if ye receive it not, you follow the
institutes of Ahriman, and hell shall be your
abode.’ The several demonstrations of Zardusht
and his wondrous works are to you an
abundant proof of the truth of his faith. Know
also that at first he sought the world; but finally
regarded wife, children, and relations as strangers
to himself; he has moreover attained to such perfect
faith, that the king and the mendicant are
the same in his sight. He has enjoined me nothing
more than this: neither has he given me
permission to be your intercessor or to entreat
from him remission of your sins: for protection
extended to the evil doer is itself criminal, and
the chastisement of evil deeds is true religion: he
enjoined me also to entertain hope of his favor
from my words and deeds.”</p>

<p>It is also expressly stated in the glorious Koran
to the same purport:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_420" id="fnanchor_420"></a><a href="#footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a></span>
“On the very day when the
spirit (Gabriel) and the angels shall be ranged in
their order, nobody shall speak except him to
whom the Merciful will permit it, and who will say
nothing but what is just.” In another place it is
declared:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_421" id="fnanchor_421"></a><a href="#footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a></span>
“Truly thou canst not direct whomsoever
thou lovest; but God will direct whomsoever
he pleases.” It is also recorded in the traditions,
that the asylum of prophecy (on whom be blessings!)
said to the beautiful Fatima: “O Fatima! fear nothing,
for thou art the prophet’s daughter; perform
good works! again I say, perform good
works!” He also proposed this additional proof!
“Not one of the eminent, eloquent, learned, or wise
men of the world can produce a composition which
in the least resembles the volume I have sent down;
if they are able let them declare it; but as they are
unable, let them confess that this is the voice of
God: a similar statement has also been made in
the divine words of the Koran: ‘produce ye a
chapter resembling it.’ Again of the many
prophets who appeared on earth, all were ignorant
<a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 263</span>
of future events except Zardusht, who, in
the <cite>Zend-Avesta</cite>, clearly expounded whatever was
to come to pass until the day of judgment, whether
good or evil.”</p>

<p>It is generally reported that Zardusht was of
<span class="place">Azarbadgán</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_422" id="fnanchor_422"></a><a href="#footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a></span> or <span class="place">Tabruz</span>;
but those who are not <dfn>Beh-dinians</dfn>,
or “true believers,” assert, and the writer
of this work has also heard from the Mobed <span class="person">Torru</span> of
<span class="place">Busáwári</span>, in Gujurat, that the birth-place and distinguished
<a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 264</span>
ancestors of the prophet belong to the
city of <span class="place">Rai</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_423" id="fnanchor_423"></a><a href="#footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a></span></p>

<p>A Mobed has transcribed as follows from the <span class="title">Avesta</span>
and <span class="title">Zand</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_424" id="fnanchor_424"></a><a href="#footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a></span>
when the Amshásfand Báhmán, pursuant
to God’s command, had borne the prophet Zardusht
to heaven, he thus entreated of the Almighty:
“Close the door of death against me: let that be
my miracle.” But the righteous Lord replied:
“If I close the gates of death against thee, thou
wilt not be satisfied; nay, thou wouldst entreat
death from me.” He then gave Zardusht something
like honey, on tasting of which he became
insensible; like one in a profound sleep has visions,
he became acquainted with the mysteries of existence,
clearly perceiving the good and evil of whatever
is in being; nay, he knew the number of hairs
on the sheep, and the sum of the leaves on a tree.
When his senses were restored, the Almighty asked
him: “What hast thou seen?” He answered:
<a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 265</span>
O supreme ruler! I beheld in hell, along with
Ahriman, many wealthy persons who had been
ungrateful in this world; and I found in the supreme
paradise many persons, rich in gold and
silver, who had worshipped the Lord and been
grateful to him. I moreover saw in hell many
who were eminent for wealth, but who were
childless; and many an indigent Durvesh, the
father of many children, in the enjoyment of
paradise. I saw moreover a tree with seven
branches,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_425" id="fnanchor_425"></a><a href="#footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a></span>
the shadow of which extended far
and wide; one branch of gold, the second of silver,
the third of copper, the fourth of brass, the
fifth of tin (or lead), the sixth of steel, the seventh
of mixed iron.” The Lord then said to his prophet:
<a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 266</span>
“The tree with seven branches is the series
of events in the world, in which agitation arises
from seven sources through the revolution of the
spheres; the first or golden branch typifies the
way and attraction by which thou hast come to
my presence and attained the prophet’s office;
the second or silver branch signifies that the great
sovereign of the age shall receive thy system of
faith, and that the demons shall hide themselves
in dismay; the third or copper branch is the period
of the Ashkanian kings.</p>

Almighty answered thus: “Pain is not to last for

arrayed in red vestments and helmets shall come
forth from the formidable room; and the land of
Khorasan be desolate by flood and vapor; the
earth shall tremble and the cultivated fields be

then said: “O, Lord! however short the duration
of this people may be, they will surely destroy
life; how then shall these wicked be exterminated?”
To which he received this answer:
“The standard of an army arises out of Khorasan,
and then Hoshidar is separated from his mother;
when he arrives at the age of thirty, he will follow

The Mobed <span class="person">Azar Khirad</span> relates in his book that the
<span class="title">Zand</span> contains twenty-one <dfn>Nosks</dfn>, or “parts,” every
<span class="title">Nosk</span> having a particular name in Zand and Parsi
according to the following
list:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_429" id="fnanchor_429"></a><a href="#footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a></span> <span class="title">Yathá</span>,

<span class="title">Nadar</span>, which they call in Arabic
<span class="trans">Búfastál</span>, and in Parsi <span class="trans">Favaímasíhan</span>. This Nosk
treats of the stars, constellations, order of the
<a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 274</span>
heavens, the aspects, the good and evil influences of
the heavenly bodies, and such like topics. The
other Nosks are: the <span class="title">Ashád</span>, <span class="title">Chíd</span>,
<span class="title">Hashú</span>, <span class="title">Wankawísh</span>,
<a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 275</span>

<span class="title">Ahrá</span>, <span class="title">Ayám</span>, <span class="title">Darkúbíú</span> and <span class="title">Astarám</span>:
all the sciences are contained in the Zand, but some
are mentioned enigmatically and by way of allusion.
At present there are fourteen complete Nosks possessed
by the Dostúrs of Karman, the other seven
being incomplete, as through the wars and dissensions
which prevailed in Iran some of the Nosks
<a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 276</span>
have disappeared, so that, notwithstanding the
greatest researches, the Nosks have come into their
hands in a defective state.</p>

<p>Zaratusht Báhrám, the son of <span class="person">Pazhdú</span>, relates
that, at the time of the promulgation of the pure
faith in Iran, there lived in India a sage of profound
learning, named <span class="person">Jangrangháchah</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_430" id="fnanchor_430"></a><a href="#footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a></span>
whose pupil <span class="person">Jamasp</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_431" id="fnanchor_431"></a><a href="#footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a></span>
had been during many years, a circumstance
which procured him great distinction. On being
informed of Gushtasp’s conversion, he wrote an
epistle to the great king, to dissuade him from the
profession of the pure faith. By the king’s command,
this sage came to Iran to hold a disputation
with Zardusht, who said to him: “Listen to one
Nosk of this Asta which I have received from God,
<a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 277</span>
and attend to its interpretation.” Upon this, at
the illustrious prophet’s command, one of his disciples
read a Nosk in which God said thus to Zardusht:
“On the promulgation of the pure faith, there
shall come from Hindustan a wise man, named
<span class="person">Jangrangháchah</span>, who will ask thee questions, after
such and such guise, the answers to which are
after this manner, thus answering all his questions:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“By this same Nosk his condition was improved,</div>
  <div class="i0">And the answer to each question was correctly given.”</div>
 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>When he heard the solutions of his questions he
fell from his chair, and on recovering his senses
adopted the pure faith. The prophet Sásán the
Fifth, in his select commentary on the <span class="title">Dasátir</span> and
the interpretation of the code of Zardusht, relates,
that when Isfendiar had promulgated the pure faith,
the eminent sages of Greece dispatched a learned
man, named <span class="person">Niyátús</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_432" id="fnanchor_432"></a><a href="#footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a></span>
to interrogate the prophet of
<a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 278</span>
the Lord concerning the exact nature of his tenets.
Gushtasp, having assigned him an audience on a
most auspicious day. this distinguished Greek, on
<a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 279</span>
beholding the face of Zardusht, said: “From this
face, knowledge, sagacity, and science are manifest
as the properties of a mind so formed; and this
is not the physiognomy of one who utters falsehoods.”
He then asked him concerning the moment,
day, month, and year of his birth, which being
communicated by Zardusht, Niyátús observed:
“Under such a horoscope, a person of weak intellects
cannot be born.” He next questioned him
concerning his food, sleep, and mode of life, which
being also explained, Niyátús added: “From this
rule of life he cannot be an impostor.” The prophet
of the Lord then said to him: “Keep in thy
heart whatever thou desirest to inquire about, and
utter it not with thy tongue; as the Almighty has
acquainted me with it, and for my sake has sent
me his word in this chapter relative to these matters.”
On this, one of the prophet’s disciples
read to Niyátús, out of a single chapter, all that was
laid up in the noble envoy’s breast, and whatever he
<a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 280</span>
was commissioned to enquire about, at the desire of
the eminent men of Greece.</p>

<p>The Fifth Sásán, in like manner, relates that when
the report of Jangrangháchah’s having adopted the
faith was published abroad, a sage, by name
<span class="person">Byásá</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_433" id="fnanchor_433"></a><a href="#footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a></span>
<a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 281</span>
came from India to Iran; and the sages of every
country being assembled, pursuant to the great
king’s command, Biyása thus addressed the prophet
<a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 282</span>
of the Lord in the presence of all: “O, Zardusht!
in consequence of thy answers and unfolding of
mysteries to the wise Jangrangháchah, thou art
accounted a true prophet. I have besides heard
of innumerable miracles performed by thee. Know
that I also, in my own country, am reckoned as
one who is unequalled both in the theoretical
and practical sciences. I now hope that thou
wilt disclose the secrets which I have kept pent
up in my bosom, and have never in any manner
transferred from the page of my heart to the lip:
some people tell us that the genii impart knowledge
of this kind to the worshippers of Ahriman:
however if thou canst unfold all these secrets, I
shall turn to thy faith.” The prophet of the Lord
said: “Long before thy arrival, the God of purity
made all known to me.” He then recited a <dfn>Simnad</dfn>,
“chapter,” which the Lord had sent down on
those subjects; in which was specified whatever
was in Byása’s heart, with the answer attached to
it; after which Byása listened to the word of God,
and having made profession of the pure faith, returned
<a name="Page_283" id="Page_283"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 283</span>
to Hindustan. It is to be remarked that the
two Simnad which contain the answers to the eminent
envoy of the Greeks and the sage Byasa do not
form a part of the Astawazand, but constitute a
portion of the Desátir,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_434" id="fnanchor_434"></a><a href="#footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a></span>
or of the celestial volume, in
the language of which a chapter is styled a Simnad.</p>

<p>Moreover, Zaratusht Báhrám thus relates concerning
the account of heaven and hell given by
<span class="person">Ardaiviráf</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_435" id="fnanchor_435"></a><a href="#footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a></span>
It is recorded that, when the power of
<span class="person">Ardeshir Babagan</span> was firmly established, he assembled
around him forty thousand virtuous Mobeds
and Dustars, out of which number he selected four
thousand; of those thus selected he set apart four
hundred, who knew by heart the greater part of the
Asta; of these four hundred he again chose out forty
learned doctors; and from these he selected seven
unblemished sages, equally free from mortal and venial
sins, whom he thus addressed: “Let whichever
of you is able divest himself of body, and bring us
intelligence concerning heaven and hell.” These
righteous men made answer: “For such a purpose
<a name="Page_284" id="Page_284"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 284</span>
there is required a man who from the age of seven
upwards has not committed sin.” After which
these sages selected from amongst them one, named
<span class="person">Ardai Viráf</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_436" id="fnanchor_436"></a><a href="#footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a></span>
whom they knew to be possessed of
this excellence, and, accompanied by the great king,
they all repaired to <span class="place">Azar Khúrdád</span>, which was a fire-temple;
having there prepared a golden throne for
<span class="person">Ardai Viráf</span>, the forty thousand professors of the
faith performed <dfn>Yazash</dfn>, that is, recited prayers according
to the prescribed mode. Ardáiviráf, having
drunk a cup of hallowed wine which he received
from the Dustur, lay down on his couch and did not
arise before the expiration of a week; his spirit,
through the efficacy of the divine word, having been
separated from the body, those six Dustúrs all the
while standing around his pillow. On the eighth
day Ardáí, arising from sleep, ordered a scribe to be
brought, who should commit to writing all his
<a name="Page_285" id="Page_285"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 285</span>
words; and he thus spoke:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_437" id="fnanchor_437"></a><a href="#footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a></span>
“When I fell asleep,
<span class="title">Sirushi</span>, who is called also <span class="title">Surúsh Ashú</span>, or <span class="title">Ashú</span> simply,
or ‘the Angel of paradise,’ came near. Having
made my salám, I explained the motives of my
coming to the other world. He took my hand and
said: ‘Ascend three steps.’ I obeyed, and arrived
at the <dfn>Chanyud Pul</dfn>, or ‘the straight bridge of judgment’
(the sarát of the Muhammedans). The
accompanying Angel pointed me out the road,
when I beheld a bridge finer than a hair and
sharper than a razor, and strong, and its length
was seven-and-thirty <dfn>rasans</dfn>, or
cords.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_438" id="fnanchor_438"></a><a href="#footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a></span> I beheld
<a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 286</span>
a spirit just parted from the body in a state of
tranquillity; on its arrival at the bridge of judgment,
a fragrant gale came from mid-day or the
east, out of which issued forth a beautiful nymph-like
form, the like of which I never before beheld.
The spirit asked her: ‘Who art thou of such
surpassing beauty?’ She replied: ‘I am the
personification of thy good deeds.’</p>

<p>“I then saw <span class="title">Mihr Ized</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_439" id="fnanchor_439"></a><a href="#footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a></span>
at whose side were standing
<a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 287</span>
<span class="title">Rash Rast</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_440" id="fnanchor_440"></a><a href="#footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a></span>
and <span class="title">Sarúsh Ized</span> holding a balance
in his hand, and angels assembled around them.
Now Mihr Ized is the angel whose province it is to
number and estimate people in regard to rewards
and punishments. Rash is his minister of justice
and the lord of equity; and Sarúsh is the lord of
messages and the master of announcements. To
these I made my salam which they returned, and
I passed over the bridge.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_441" id="fnanchor_441"></a><a href="#footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a></span>
Several spirits then
<a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 288</span>
appeared who addressed me affectionately; Báhmán
next appeared and said to me: ‘Come on,
that I may show thee the <dfn>Gah-i-zarin’</dfn> (or golden
place, which is the same as the celestial throne).
I proceeded with him to a beautiful throne, where
I beheld the spirit before mentioned, whose deeds
were personified by a beauteous form, with the
<dfn>Ashwan</dfn>, or ‘pure spirits,’ and the inhabitants of
paradise around him, with the spirits of his relations
rejoicing as on the arrival of a long-absent
traveller from his abode; then Báhmán took his
hand and brought him to a place worthy of him.
When I had proceeded a little onwards, I beheld
a lofty portico, where by order of Surúsh I addressed
my prayers towards the place of God, and
my sight became darkened through the effulgence
of light. Surúsh again brought me back to the
bridge of judgment, around which I beheld a number
of persons standing with folded hands. I
asked: ‘Who are those persons?’ Surúsh answered:
<a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 289</span>
‘These are the weak in faith, who remain
in this state until the day of judgment: if they
possessed an additional particle of virtue, equal
in weight to one of the hairs of the eyelash,
they would be relieved from this calamity.’ I
then beheld another assemblage like unto shining
stars. Surush said: ‘This is the <dfn>Satra
Payah</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_442" id="fnanchor_442"></a><a href="#footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a></span>
(or the sphere of the fixed stars); in these are a
people who with all their wealth observed not
the <dfn>Gítí Kharíd</dfn><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_443" id="fnanchor_443"></a><a href="#footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a></span>
(the purchase of the other world)
and the <dfn>Naú Roz</dfn> (or the festival of the new
year.)’ He next brought me to the <dfn>Máh Páyah</dfn>
(or lunar sphere), where I beheld spirits resplendent
as the moon. The angel said: ‘this <span class="title">Máh
Páyah</span> is also one of the spheres of paradise, in
which are those who have performed every kind
of meritorious act and deed, except observing
the <span class="title">Naú Roz</span>.’ He then conducted me to the
<dfn>Khúrshíd Páyah</dfn> (or solar sphere) where I beheld
<a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 290</span>
spirits exceedingly bright, radiant as the sun.
The angel said: ‘In the solar sphere are the
persons who have observed the <span class="title">Gítí Kharíd</span> and
the <span class="title">Naú Roz</span>.’ At his command, I then addressed
my prayers to the <span class="title">Warakt</span> and <span class="title">Khurah-i-Yazdan</span>,
or ‘light of the Almighty:’ perception
and intellect, through the effects of terror and
overpowering awe, began to flee from me; a voice,
however, from which I obtained renovated energy,
came to my hearing: there was then some
oil<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_444" id="fnanchor_444"></a><a href="#footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a></span>
given me to drink out of a golden cup: I partook
of it and found it of an incomparable taste: they
told me that it was the food of the people of paradise.
I next beheld <span class="title">Ardi Behést</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_445" id="fnanchor_445"></a><a href="#footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a></span>
to whom I made
my salam. He said to me: ‘Place on the sacred
fire wood free from moisture.’ Surush then
bore me off to <dfn>Kurutaman</dfn>, or ‘paradise,’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_446" id="fnanchor_446"></a><a href="#footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a></span>
in the
light of which I became bewildered in astonishment:
<a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 291</span>
I knew none of the precious stones of
which it was composed. The angels, by the command
of the Almighty, took me round every part
of it. I next came to a place where I beheld an
illustrious assemblage enveloped in <dfn>Khurah</dfn>, that
is, ‘radiance and pomp.’ <span class="person">Surúsh Ashir</span> said:
‘These are the spirits of the munificent and noble-minded.’
After this I saw a great multitude in
all magnificence. Surúsh explained to me:
‘These are the spirits of all who have observed
the <span class="title">Naú Roz</span>.’ Next them I beheld an assemblage
in the enjoyment of all magnificence and
happiness. Surúsh observed: ‘These are the spirits
of just princes.’ After this I beheld blessed
spirits in boundless joy and power. Surush explained:
‘These are the Dustúrs and Mobeds:
my duty is to convey that class to this honor.’
I next beheld a company of women rejoicing in
the midst of great pomp. Surúsh Ashú and
Ardibahést observed: ‘These are the spirits of
women who were obedient to their husbands.’
I then beheld a multitude of majestic and beautiful
persons, seated along with angels. Surúsh said:
‘this class consists of Hírbuds and Mobeds, the
attendants on fire-temples, and the observers of
the <span class="title">Yasht</span> and <span class="title">Yazisht</span>
of the Amshasfands.’ After
these I saw an armed assemblage in a state of the
highest joy. Surúsh informed me: ‘These are
<a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 292</span>
the spirits of the champions who fought in the
ways of God, maintaining their country and the
husbandmen in a state of prosperity and tranquillity.’
I next beheld a great assemblage in
the enjoyment of all delight and gladness. Surúsh
observed: ‘These are the spirits of the slayers
of the <dfn>Khurástár</dfn> (or noxious
animals).’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_447" id="fnanchor_447"></a><a href="#footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a></span> After
this, I witnessed a people given up to sporting
and happiness. Surush observed: ‘These are the
spirits of the husbandmen, over whom <span class="title">Safándarmuz</span>
is set; he consequently presides over this
class, as they have propitiated him by their
acts.’ I next beheld a great company surrounded
by all the appliances of enjoyment. Surúsh said:
‘These are the spirits of shepherds.’ After this,
I beheld great numbers in a state of repose and
joy, and the elemental principles of paradise standing
before them. Surúsh observed: ‘These are
the heads of families, friends to building, who
have improved the world by gardens and water-courses,
and held the elements in reverence.’
I next came to another class, endowed with prophet-like
radiance, of whom Surúsh remarked:
‘These are the spirits of <span class="title">Jádóngóis</span>.’ By <dfn>Jádóngóis</dfn>
is meant one who solicits money from the wealthy
<a name="Page_293" id="Page_293"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 293</span>
to promote the way of the Lord, and who expends
it on noble foundations and holy indigent persons.</p>

<p>“What can I say concerning the black-eyed
nymphs&mdash;the palaces, offspring, and attendants&mdash;the
drinks and viands?&mdash;any thing like which
I know not of in this elemental world.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_448" id="fnanchor_448"></a><a href="#footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a></span></p>

<p>“After this Surúsh and Ardibehést, taking me
<a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 294</span>
out of paradise, bore me off to behold the punishments
inflicted on those in hell. First of all,
I beheld a black and gloomy river of fetid water,
with weeping multitudes falling in and drowning.
Surúsh said: ‘This water is collected from the
tears shed by relatives on the death of a person;
and those who are drowning are they whose
relatives, after their death, break out into
mourning, weeping, and tears.’ I next proceeded
towards the bridge of judgment, where I
beheld a spirit rent from the body, and mourning
for its separation: there arose a fetid gale, out of
which issued a gloomy figure, with red eye-balls,
hooked nose, hideous lips, teeth like columns, a
head like the kettle of a
minaret,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_449" id="fnanchor_449"></a><a href="#footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a></span>
long talons,
spear-like fangs, snaky locks, and vomiting out
smoke. The alarmed spirit having asked, ‘Who
art thou?’ he answered, ‘I am the personification
of thy acts and deeds.’ On saying this, he
threw his hands around the spirit’s neck, so that
his lamentations came to the bridge of judgment,
which is sharper than a razor: on this the spirit
having gone a little way with great difficulty, at
last fell into the infernal regions. I then followed
him, accompanied by Súrush and Ardibehest: our
road lay through snow, ice, storms, intense cold,
<a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 295</span>
mephitic exhalations, and obscurity, along a region
full of pits: into these I looked, and there beheld
countless myriads of spirits suffering tortures.
They all wailed bitterly, and the darkness was so
thick that one was unable to perceive the other, or
to distinguish his lamentation: three days such
punishment is equal to nine thousand years, and
the same calculation applies to the other pits, in
all of which were serpents, scorpions, stinging
and noxious creatures: whatever spirit falls into
them</p>

<div class="poem-container">

 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>“Surúsh having taken me below, I there beheld a
spirit with a human head and serpent-like body,
surrounded by many demons who were applying
the torture to his feet, and smiting him in every
direction with hatchets, daggers, and maces,
whilst noxious creatures were biting him on all
sides. Surúsh observed: ‘This was a man of vile
passions.’ I next saw a woman who held in her
hand a cup filled with blood and corrupted matter;
demons kept striking her with clubs and
spears until she swallowed the nauseous draught,
on which they instantly replaced a similar bowl
in her hands. Surúsh remarked: ‘This woman,
whilst laboring under periodical illness, approached
the elements, of fire and water.’ I
<a name="Page_296" id="Page_296"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 296</span>
then beheld a man wailing piteously, whose head
they were scalping with a poniard: Surúsh said:
‘This was a shedder of innocent blood.’ I next
saw a man who was forced to swallow blood and
corrupted matter, with which they were continually
supplying him. The demons in the mean
time tortured him, and placed a heavy mountain
on his breast: Surúsh stated this to be ‘The spirit
of a dissolute man, who seduced the wives of
other men.’ After this, I beheld a spirit weeping
through hunger and thirst; so intense was his
craving, that he drank his own blood and devoured
his own flesh. Surúsh stated: ‘This is the spirit
of one who observed not the
<span class="title">Báj</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_450" id="fnanchor_450"></a><a href="#footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a></span> when partaking
of food,’” (Báj is a rite practised by orthodox
Parsees before meat, as has been explained under
the head of banquet) “‘and who on the day of
Aban<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_451" id="fnanchor_451"></a><a href="#footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a></span>
partook of water, fruit, and bread, so that
the angels <span class="title">Khurdád</span>
and <span class="title">Murdád</span> were displeased
with him.’ I next beheld a woman suspended
by her breasts and noxious creatures falling on
her. Surúsh said: ‘this is a woman who deserted
her husband and went after another man.’ I
<a name="Page_297" id="Page_297"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 297</span>
then saw a great multitude of spirits, furiously
assailed by rapacious animals and noxious creatures.
Surúsh stated thus: ‘These are persons
who adopted not the <dfn>Kashti</dfn><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_452" id="fnanchor_452"></a><a href="#footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a></span>
or sacred cincture as
worn by professors of the excellent faith.’ I next
beheld a woman hung up, with her tongue protruding
from the hind part of the neck. Surúsh
observed: ‘This is a woman who obeyed not her
husband, and replied to him with harsh answers
and opposition.’ I then saw a man eating with
a ladle the most noxious things, of which if he
took too small a portion, demons smote him with
wooden clubs. Surúsh observed: ‘this is the
spirit of one who betrayed his trust.’ I after this
<a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 298</span>
beheld a man hung up, surrounded by seventy
demons, who were lashing him with serpents
instead of scourges; and meanwhile the serpents
kept gnawing his flesh with their fangs. Surúsh
Ashú said: ‘This is a king who extorted money
from his subjects by torture.’ I next beheld a
man with wide-opened mouth and protruding
tongue,</p>

<div class="poem-container">

  <div class="i0b">“With serpents and scorpions covered all over,</div>
  <div class="i0">The one lacerating with fangs, the others lashing with their tails.</div>

<p class="unindent">“Surúsh said: ‘This was a tale-bearer, who by his
lies caused dissension and strife among mankind.’
After this I saw a man, every ligature
and joint of whose body they were tearing asunder.
Surúsh said: ‘This person has slain many four-footed
animals.’ I next beheld a man exposed
to body-rending torture, concerning whom Surúsh
said: ‘This was a wealthy, avaricious man, who
employed not his riches for the useful purposes
of either world.’ I then saw a person to whom
were offered all sorts of noxious creatures, whilst
one foot was free from all kind of suffering. Surúsh
said concerning him: ‘This is the spirit of a
negligent person, who did not in the least attend
to the concerns of the world or the world to
come. As he once passed along the road, he
observed a goat tied up in such a manner that it
was unable to get at its food: with that foot he
<a name="Page_299" id="Page_299"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 299</span>
tossed the forage towards the animal, in recompense
of which good act that foot is exempt from
suffering.’ I next beheld a person whose tongue
was laid on a stone, and demons kept beating it
with another. Concerning him Surúsh observed:
‘This person was an habitual slanderer and liar,
through whose words people fell into mischief.’
I then saw a woman whose breasts the demons
were grinding under a millstone. About her
Surúsh observed: ‘This woman produced abortion
by means of drugs.’ I next beheld a man in
whose seven members worms had fixed themselves.
Concerning him Surúsh said: ‘This person
gave false witness for money, and derived
his support from that resource.’ After this I
saw a man devouring the flesh of a corpse and
drinking human gore. Surúsh observed: ‘This
is the spirit of one who amassed wealth by unlawful
means.’ I afterwards beheld a great
multitude with pallid faces, fetid bodies, and limbs
covered with worms. About these Surúsh Ashú
observed: ‘These are hypocrites of satanic qualities,
whose hearts were not in accordance with
their words, and who led astray the professors of
the excellent faith, divesting themselves of all
respect for religion and morality.’ I next saw
a man the members of whose body hell-hounds
were rending asunder. Concerning him Surúsh
<a name="Page_300" id="Page_300"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 300</span>
said: ‘This man was in the habit of slaughtering
water and land dogs.’ I next beheld a woman
hurled into snow and smitten by the guardians of
fire. About her Surúsh said: ‘When this woman
combed herself, her hairs fell into the fire.’ After
this I beheld another woman tearing off with a
poniard the flesh of her own body and devouring
it. Surush said: ‘This is an enchantress who used
to fascinate men.’ Next her I saw a man whom
the demons forced by blows to swallow blood,
corrupted matter, and human flesh. Concerning
him Surúsh said: ‘This man was in the habit of
casting dead bodies, corrupted matter, nails, and
hair into fire and water.’ I afterwards beheld a
person devouring the flesh and skin of a dead
body. Surúsh said: ‘This person defrauded the
labourers of their hire.’ I next beheld a man
with a mountain on his back, whom with his
load they forced through terror into the midst of
snows and ice. Surúsh observed: ‘This was an
adulterer, who took the wife from her husband.’
I afterwards saw a number of ill-fated persons up
to their necks in ice and snow, before each of
whom was a cup filled with gore, and hair, and
impurities, which, through terror of blows and
clubs, they were obliged to swallow. Surúsh observed:
‘These are persons who used warm bathing
along with the <dfn>Batardeen</dfn> (or the enemies of the
<a name="Page_301" id="Page_301"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 301</span>
faith) washing their bodies and heads in such
unclean and polluted baths.’ I then beheld a
person groaning under the weight of a mountain.
Concerning him Surúsh said: ‘This man laid
heavy taxes on the people, established evil ordinances,
and oppressed mankind.’ Next him I
beheld one digging up a mountain with his fingers
and nails, whilst the superintendent kept smiting
him with a viper. Surúsh said: ‘This is a man
who by violence seized on the lands of others:’</p>

</div><!--end poem-->

<p class="unindent">I afterwards saw a man the flesh of whose shoulders
and body they were scraping off with a comb
of iron. Concerning him Surúsh said: ‘This man
was an egregious violator of promises and
breaker of engagements.’ I then beheld a great
multitude whose hands and feet they were smiting
with bludgeons, iron maces, and such like.
Concerning these Surúsh observed: ‘This class
is composed of promise-breakers and the violators
of covenants, who maintained friendship
with <dfn>Darwands</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_453" id="fnanchor_453"></a><a href="#footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a></span>
or those hostile to the faith.’
<a name="Page_302" id="Page_302"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 302</span>
Surúsh, Ashú, and Ardibehest then led me from
that abode of misery to <dfn>Girutuman</dfn>, ‘the seat of
supreme bliss,’ or ‘paradise on high,’ which is
called ‘the heaven of heavens.’ On beholding
the light and splendor of the righteous Lord, I
became entranced, and this spirit-reviving voice
reached my ears: ‘Through thy virtuous words
and actions, which have been conformable to
the excellent faith, joined to the co-operation
and energy of intellect, though hast resisted all
the demons which infest the body, and hast
therefore attained to this rank.’ Surúsh then
taking me by the hand, said: ‘Communicate to
mankind all thou hast heard.’ He next took
me down to paradise, where several spirits received
me and said: ‘Reveal these mysteries to
our relations, that they may beware of sin.’ I
next came to the lunar mansion, where they addressed
me in the same manner. I afterwards
reached the starry mansion with the same two
companions, and here also the spirits advanced
to receive me, saying: ‘Counsel our relations to
make <span class="title">Yasht</span> and <dfn>Yazisht</dfn> (to pray in a low murmuring
tone at meal-time) and to cleave firmly to
the festival of the <span class="title">Naú Roz</span>, and the girding of
<a name="Page_303" id="Page_303"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 303</span>
the cincture; had we observed these rites, we
should not have remained in this mansion, but
gone on to Paradise.’ It appears to follow from
what has been stated, that the starry mansion or
zodiacal sphere is below that of the moon; the
Yezdanians however say, that the starry mansion
signifies the mansion of the spirits who below the
lunar sphere are not exempted from sufferings,
but are attached to the bodies of the virtuous by
means of the zodiacal
signs.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_454" id="fnanchor_454"></a><a href="#footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a></span></p>

<p>“I next came to <dfn>Chínawad Pul</dfn> (the bridge of judgment)
where many spirits thus addressed me:
‘Tell men to leave sons behind them in the
world, or otherwise they must, like us, remain
here.’</p>

<div class="poem-container">

<p class="p2">When the scribe had written down all the words

assembled.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_457" id="fnanchor_457"></a><a href="#footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a></span> Azarbad,
having performed his ablutions, lay down before

mans of melted brass upon his bared breast, but,
through the divine glory, his person received no
injury. On beholding this, all those who before
had been unbelievers, embraced the faith. From
the time of Azarbád the Dustúrs of all succeeding
kings were of his
lineage.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_458" id="fnanchor_458"></a><a href="#footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a></span></p>

<p>The professors of the excellent faith and the
Moslem historians agree, that in Kashmir or
Kashmar,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_459" id="fnanchor_459"></a><a href="#footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a></span>
a place celebrated for female beauty, a dependency
of Naishapur, there was formerly a
cypress<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_460" id="fnanchor_460"></a><a href="#footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a></span>
<a name="Page_307" id="Page_307"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 307</span>
planted by Zardusht for king Gushtasp, the like of
which was never seen before or since, for beauty,
height, or straightness: mention of this tree having
been made at the court of
Mutawakkal<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_461" id="fnanchor_461"></a><a href="#footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a></span>
when he was
engaged in building the <span class="title">Sarman raï</span>,
or <span class="place">Samarah</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_462" id="fnanchor_462"></a><a href="#footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a></span>
palace in the Jâafriyah,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_463" id="fnanchor_463"></a><a href="#footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a></span>
the Khalif felt a great desire
to behold it: and as it was not in his power to go to
Khorasan, he wrote to <span class="title">Abdallah Táhir Zavalimin</span>,
“possessor of happiness,” to have the tree cut
down, fastened on rollers, and sent to Baghdád.
When intelligence of this came to the people of the
district and the inhabitants of Khorasan, they assembled
at the foot of the tree, imploring for mercy with
tears and lamentations, and exhibiting a scene of
general desolation. The professors of the excellent
faith offered the governor fifty thousand dinars to
spare the tree, but the offer was refused. When the
<a name="Page_308" id="Page_308"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 308</span>
cypress was felled, it caused great detriment to the
buildings and water-courses of the country; the
birds of different kinds which had built their nests
on it issued forth in such countless myriads as to
darken the air, screaming out in agony with various
tones of distress: the very oxen, sheep, and other
animals which reposed under its sheltering shade,
commenced such piteous moans of woe that it was
impossible to listen to them. The expense of conveying
the trunk to Baghdad was five hundred thousand
dinars; the very branches loaded one thousand and
three hundred camels. When the tree had reached
one station from the Jaafriyah quarter, on that same
night, Mutawakkal the Abasside was cut in pieces by
his own guards,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_464" id="fnanchor_464"></a><a href="#footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a></span>
so that he never beheld the tree.
Some Muhammedan writers state the circumference
of the trunk at twenty-seven <dfn>táziáynah</dfn>, each a cubit
and a quarter long, and also that fourteen hundred
and fifty years had elapsed from the time of its being
planted to the year 232 of the Hejirah (846, A. D.).<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_465" id="fnanchor_465"></a><a href="#footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a></span>

The Behdínians say that Zardusht brought with him
from paradise a branch which he planted at the gate
of the fire temple of Kashmir, and which grew up
into this tree: but some sages maintain that, according
to the intelligent, this tradition signifies: 1. that
there is in vegetables a simple uncompounded soul;
and 2. that paradise is the world of beings of that
class. Some Yezdanians say that Zardusht prayed
the superintending lord of cypress-trees, whom they
call <span class="title">Azrawán</span>, to nourish carefully the offspring of
this shoot. They also relate, on the authority of a
holy <dfn>Hakim</dfn>, “doctor,”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_466" id="fnanchor_466"></a><a href="#footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a></span>
who said: “I saw the Lord
of the cypress, and he declared: ‘I have given
orders to slay Mutawakkal for the crime of cutting
down this tree.’” Muhammed Kuli Salim

  <div class="i0b">“The mighty, through means of the Asta, Zand, and Pazand,</div>
  <div class="i0">Have constructed on its outside a hundred gates.</div>
  <div class="i0">Behold what a system of belief Zardusht has introduced,</div>
  <div class="i0">In which a hundred gates give admission to his city of Faith.”</div>
 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the first</span> is the belief and acknowledgment
of Zardusht’s prophetic character; for when the
spirit on the fourth night (after quitting the body)
<a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 311</span>
comes to the bridge of Chinavad, where <span class="title">Mihr Ized</span>
and <span class="title">Rash Ized</span> take account of its actions, in the <dfn>Kirfah</dfn>,
or “good deeds” exceed the sins by one hair’s
point, they bear the spirit off to paradise, but always
on the condition of having professed the faith of
Zardusht.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the second.</span> It is necessary to be ever vigilant,
and always looking on a trifling sin as one of
magnitude, to flee far from it; because, if the virtuous
deeds exceed the sinful acts by even the point of
one of the hairs of the eye-lashes, the spirit goes to
paradise; but should the contrary be the case, it
descends to hell.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the third.</span> The pursuits of a man should be
of a virtuous tendency; because, whilst thus engaged,
if he be overpowered by robbers or foes, he shall
receive fourfold in paradise; but if he be slain in any
vain pursuit, it is the retribution due to his acts,
and hell is his abode.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the fourth.</span> A man must not despair of
God’s mercy; for Zardusht says: “I beheld one
whose body, with the exception of one foot, was
entirely in hell; but that foot was outside. The
Lord said: ‘This person, who ruled over thirty-three
cities, never performed good deeds; but
having one day observed a sheep tied up at a
<a name="Page_312" id="Page_312"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 312</span>
distance from her food, he with this foot pushed
the grass near her.’”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_468" id="fnanchor_468"></a><a href="#footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the fifth.</span> Let all men exert themselves to
observe the rites of <span class="title">Yasht</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_469" id="fnanchor_469"></a><a href="#footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a></span>
and the <span class="title">Naú Roz</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_470" id="fnanchor_470"></a><a href="#footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a></span> and if
they cannot themselves perform these duties, let
them purchase the agency of another.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the sixth.</span> Let men know that the meritorious
works are six in number: 1. the observance
of the <dfn>Gahambara</dfn>, or “six periods of creation;”
2. that of the <dfn>Favardigan</dfn>, or “five supplementary
days of the year,” with that of <dfn>Yashtan</dfn>,
“or praying in a low murmuring voice at meals;”
3. propitiating the spirits of thy father, mother, and
other relations; 4. offering up supplications to the
sun three times every day; 5. offering up prayers to
the moon three times every month, that is, the
beginning, middle, and last day of the moon; 6.
offering up supplications in due form every year.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 313</span>
<span class="sc">Gate the seventh.</span> When sneezing comes on,
repeat the entire of the forms called <span class="title">Ita ahu
virio</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_471" id="fnanchor_471"></a><a href="#footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a></span>
and the <span class="title">Ashem Vuhu</span>.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the eighth.</span> Be obedient to the Dustúrs
and give them one-tenth of thy wealth; as that is a
most meritorious work, or
<dfn>Kirfah</dfn>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_472" id="fnanchor_472"></a><a href="#footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 314</span>
<span class="sc">Gate the ninth.</span> A person should avoid all practices
not sanctioned by the laws of nature, and must
look on them as accursed: let all those found guilty
of such deeds be put to death. This description of
criminals are equally guilty with the usurper Zohak,
and Alkus,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_473" id="fnanchor_473"></a><a href="#footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a></span>
and Sarúrak,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_474" id="fnanchor_474"></a><a href="#footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a></span>
and Afrasiab, and Turbaraturas.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_475" id="fnanchor_475"></a><a href="#footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the tenth.</span> It is incumbent on every man and
woman to tie on the <span class="title">Kashti</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_476" id="fnanchor_476"></a><a href="#footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a></span>
By Kashti is meant
a woollen cincture girded round the waist, in which
they make four knots: the first to signify the unity
of God; the second, the certainty of the faith; the
third, that Zardusht was the prophet of God; the
fourth to imply, “that I will to the utmost of my
power ever do what is good.”</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the eleventh.</span> Keep the fire burning, and
let it not consume any thing impure.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 315</span>
<span class="sc">Gate the twelfth.</span> Let not the shroud of the deceased
be new, but let it be clean and old.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the thirteenth.</span> The good man gives joy to
the spirits of his father and mother, by celebrating
the <span class="title">Darun miezd</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_477" id="fnanchor_477"></a><a href="#footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a></span>
and the <span class="title">Afernigán</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_478" id="fnanchor_478"></a><a href="#footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a></span>
or “funereal
<a name="Page_316" id="Page_316"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 316</span>
“repasts.” The Darun is a prayer recited in praise
of the Almighty and of Azar: when they breathe out
prayers in a murmuring tone over viands, they are
<a name="Page_317" id="Page_317"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 317</span>
said to be Yeshtah. Afrinigan also means one of the
twenty Nosks of the Zand.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the fourteenth.</span> Let them repeat the Ita
Ahu three times over the collected nail-parings, and
having each time drawn a circular line around them,
let earth be poured on them with the shears, or let
them be taken to some mountain.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_479" id="fnanchor_479"></a><a href="#footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the fifteenth.</span> Whatever pleasing object
meets the true believer’s sight, he repeats over it
the name of God.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the sixteenth.</span> In the house of a pregnant
woman keep the fire in without ceasing; and when
the child is born, let not the lamp be extinguished
during three days and nights.</p>

<p>They say that, on the birth of the prophet Zardusht,
there came fifty demons with the design of
slaying him; but they were unable to do him any
injury as there was a fire kept up in the house.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the seventeenth.</span> On arising from sleep,
<a name="Page_318" id="Page_318"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 318</span>
bind the Kashti, without doing which enter upon no
pursuit whatever.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the eighteenth.</span> Let the tooth-pick, after
having been used, be concealed in a wall.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the nineteenth.</span> They give their son and
daughter in marriage at an early period; as the person
who has no son cannot pass over the bridge of
<span class="title">Chinavad</span>; let whoever is in that state adopts some
one; if he should not find it feasible, it will then be
incumbent on his relations and the Dustúr to fix on
a son for him.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the twentieth.</span> They esteem husbandry the
best of all professions, and regard the husbandman
with respect and honor.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the twenty-first.</span> It is meet to give good
viands to the professors of the pure faith.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="gate22" id="gate22"></a><span class="sc">Gate the
twenty-second.</span> At the time of eating
bread it is necessary to perform
<span class="title">Váj</span>:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_480" id="fnanchor_480"></a><a href="#footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a></span>
and at the
<a name="Page_319" id="Page_319"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 319</span>
time of <span class="time">Maizad</span> and <span class="time">Afrinigán</span> to keep the lips closed;
the true believer repeats the entire of the <span class="title">Esha âad
avizmidi</span> three times, and then eats bread; and when
he washes his mouth, he repeats <span class="title">Ashem Vuhu</span> four
times, and the <span class="title">Ita ahu virio</span> twice. It is to be remarked,
that <span class="title">Wáj</span> or <span class="title">Váj</span> is the
<dfn>Barsom</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_481" id="fnanchor_481"></a><a href="#footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a></span>
which consists
of small twigs of the same length, without
knots, taken from the pomegranate, tamarisk, or
<a name="Page_320" id="Page_320"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 320</span>
<span class="title">Hum</span>; these they cut with a <dfn>Barsomchin</dfn>, or knife with
an iron handle. Having first washed the knife carefully,
they recite the appointed prayers, after which,
having cut off the Barsom with the Barsomchin,
they wash the Barsomdan, or Barsom-holder, into
which they put these small twigs. At the time of
worship, whilst reading the Zand, and during ablution
or eating, they hold in their hand a few of
these twigs, according to the number required in
each of these actions.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the twenty-third.</span> The wealthy man bestows
alms on the indigent Durvesh; he also practises
<span class="title">Jadongoi</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_482" id="fnanchor_482"></a><a href="#footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a></span>,
which consists in this, whatever donations
the Behdínians make to the fire-temples, or to
deserving objects, are by that person caused to be
expended in the manner desired.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the twenty-fourth.</span> Beware of sin, particularly
the day on which thou eatest flesh, as flesh-meat
is the nutriment of Ahriman. If, after partaking
of meat thou committest sin, whatever sins
the animal has committed in this world shall be
imputed to thee: for example, the kick of the horse,
and the goring of the ox with his horns.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 321</span>
<span class="sc">Gate the twenty-fifth.</span> Know that in thy faith
there is no fasting, except that of avoiding sin:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_483" id="fnanchor_483"></a><a href="#footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a></span> in
which sense thou must fast the whole year, and not
remain hungry from morn until night, and style
that fasting. Thou must endeavor to keep thy members
free from sin, and there will be then no occasion
to keep the lips closed against meat and drink;
but it is altogether necessary to keep them closed
against uttering any evil speech.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the twenty-sixth.</span> As soon as a child is
born let them cause it to taste milk.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the twenty-seventh.</span> When going to bed,
repeat the forms which commence with the Ita; that
is, repeat to the end the <span class="title">Itá Ahu Viríyo</span>, the <span class="title">Eshim
Vahu</span>, etc., etc.; repenting of thy sins of sight and
hearing, known and unknown, committed or meditated,
and imploring forgiveness; also, when thou
<a name="Page_322" id="Page_322"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 322</span>
turnest from one side to the other, repeat the whole
of the Eshim.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the twenty-eighth.</span> When thou enterest
into a covenant either with one of the pure faith or
an unbeliever (<dfn>Durwand</dfn>), break it not, but maintain
it inviolate.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the twenty-ninth.</span> When the believer’s son
attains the age of fifteen, the father appoints a Dustúr
for his guidance, without whose direction and
counsel he does nothing; for no good work is acceptable
to God, unless the Dustúr be satisfied; he truly
possesses such dignity in the sight of God, that he
can remit one-third of any person’s sins. Note,
that the title of Dustúr is given to a spiritual director,
or one skilled in the faith of Zaratusht.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the thirtieth.</span> When any undertaking occurs,
and thou knowest not whether engaging in it
be good or sinful, desist, and defer the enterprise
until thou hast consulted the Dustúr.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the thirty-first.</span> The believer undertakes
nothing on his own experience merely, without
previously investigating its nature through his Dustúr,
his relation, and the experience of the intelligent.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the thirty-second.</span> Whoever studies the
Avesta must learn to read it in the exact words: he
<a name="Page_323" id="Page_323"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 323</span>
must also meditate on it continually; for should it
depart from his memory, he is guilty of sin. In
ancient times, whoever had learned the Avesta and
forgotten it, was not permitted to join the congregation,
until he had again made himself master of it:
nay, they threw bread before him as they would to
dogs.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the thirty-third.</span> It behoves a man to be
liberal, showing favor to the Arzan, or deserving
objects, for this only is profitable.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the thirty-fourth.</span> The religious pour not
out water at night, particularly towards the <dfn>Wakhtar</dfn>,
or “east;” but should it be indispensable, the believer,
at the time of throwing it out, repeats the
form of words commencing with the <span class="title">Ita</span>, as far as
enjoined. Neither does he draw water from the
well at night; but when there is an inevitable necessity
for it, he recites the formula of the Ita, as enjoined
in their books. They seldom drink water at
night; but if it be unavoidably necessary to drink,
they fetch water from the well: moreover, they
never pour out much water.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the thirty-fifth.</span> When they eat bread,
they lay by three morsels for the dogs, and never
ill use these animals.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the thirty-sixth.</span> When a cock crows out
<a name="Page_324" id="Page_324"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 324</span>
of season, they kill him not, but bring another to
his aid, for the fowl having seen a <dfn>Darji</dfn> (demon) or
some approaching calamity, gives notice of
it.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_484" id="fnanchor_484"></a><a href="#footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the thirty-seventh.</span> If in any place a person
who is destitute of fear should deposit a <dfn>Nisa</dfn>, or
“carcase” under ground, expose and bring it forth.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the thirty-eighth.</span> It is by no means meet
to slay animals in profusion, as every hair of theirs
will in the other world be as a sword to the destroyer’s
body: but the slaughter of sheep is by far
the most criminal; for they are of the
<dfn>Sardah</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_485" id="fnanchor_485"></a><a href="#footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a></span> or
“primary genus.” This prohibition includes the
goat, the kid, and the lamb; the cow and the horse;
also the crowing cock, which during that time is as
a drum: nay, it is equally improper to slay the
cock which crows not; but should it be indispensably
necessary to kill him, it will be proper to
tie his head (that is, to perform the rite of Yashtan
over his head).<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_486" id="fnanchor_486"></a><a href="#footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 325</span>
<span class="sc">Gate the thirty-ninth.</span> When thou art about to
wash the face, join thy lips, and recite once the formula
of the <span class="title">Ashim Vuhu</span> as far as is prescribed; then
wash thy face; and when thou shavest, recite the
prayer of the <span class="title">Kimna</span> and
<span class="title">Mazda</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_487" id="fnanchor_487"></a><a href="#footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a></span>
as far as the appointed
place.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the fortieth.</span> Whoever
performs <span class="title">Barashnom</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_488" id="fnanchor_488"></a><a href="#footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a></span>
must be good in word and deed, for otherwise
<a name="Page_326" id="Page_326"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 326</span>
he is deserving of death. Whoever comes to the
age of fifteen and performs not this rite, renders
whatever he lays his hand on impure like himself.
Note, that <dfn>Barashnom</dfn> signifies the purification of
one’s self by prayer.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the forty-first.</span> On the arrival of the Farvardigán,
the believer performs the <span class="title">Darún Yezd</span>,
<span class="title">Yazish</span>, and <span class="title">Afrín</span> during ten days. The Farvardigán
are five damsels which spin, weave, and sew celestial
garments: their names are <span class="title">Ahnavad</span>, <span class="title">Ashnavad</span>,
<span class="title">Isfintamad</span>, <span class="title">Kukhashatar</span>, <span class="title">Vahshúshpúsh</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_489" id="fnanchor_489"></a><a href="#footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a></span>
Farvardigan<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_490" id="fnanchor_490"></a><a href="#footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a></span>
<a name="Page_327" id="Page_327"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 327</span>
is the name of the five supplementary or intercalary
days of the Persian year. When the spirit
quits this world it is naked; but whoever has
duly performed the Farvardigán obtains from them
royal robes and celestial ornaments.</p>

<p>According to the Yezdánián, these five damsels
signify wisdom, heroism, continence, justice, and
intellect;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_491" id="fnanchor_491"></a><a href="#footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a></span>
and in other passages they call them the
five senses.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the forty-second.</span> The true believer must
beware of associating with those of a different faith;
let him not drink out of the same cup with them.
If an unbeliever pollute a cup made of brass, it must
<a name="Page_328" id="Page_328"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 328</span>
be washed three times: but if it be of earth, it cannot
become pure.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the forty-third.</span> Keep up the fire in thy
house, and at night light it up.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the forty-fourth.</span> Shew honor to thy instructor,
father, and mother; as otherwise in this
world distress shall be thy portion; and in the
next, hell.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the forty-fifth.</span> A woman, in her periodical
illness, must not direct her eyes to the heaven
or the stars; to running water or a Mindáshú; that
is, a pure or celestial man. She is to drink water
out of any vessel except one of earth. When she
eats bread, her hand is to be folded in the sleeve of
her dress,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_492" id="fnanchor_492"></a><a href="#footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a></span>
and she is to wear a veil on her head.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the forty-sixth.</span> Refrain from Hamiyál,
which means calumny, treachery, and adultery:
for if the woman’s husband forgive not the adulterer,
he cannot, whatever may be his good works, behold
the face of paradise.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the forty-seventh.</span> The believer must slay
the <dfn>Kharástár</dfn>, or “noxious creatures.” Of these
it is most meritorious to destroy water-frogs, serpents,
scorpions, flies, and ants. According to the
<a name="Page_329" id="Page_329"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 329</span>
tenets professed by the true believers, that is, the
<dfn>Yazdáníán</dfn> and <dfn>Abadián</dfn>, it is a meritorious work to
destroy any creature which is injurious to animal
life or oppressive to the animal creation: but the
destruction of any creature which is not injurious
to animal life, is not only improper, but the unjust
oppressor draws down retribution on himself. The
Yezdáníán maintain, that whenever in ancient records
the slaughter of a harmless animal is mentioned,
the expression is used in an enigmatical
sense.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the forty-eighth.</span> It is not proper to walk
barefooted.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the forty-ninth.</span> Repent without ceasing:
for unless attention be paid to this, thy sin accumulates
every year, and becomes more aggravated.
If, which God forbid! thou commit a sin,
go before the Dustúr; and if thou find him not, to
the Hírbud (or minister attending on the sacred
fire); and if thou meet him not, repair to some professor
of the pure faith; and if thou find not such a
one, declare thy repentance before the majesty of
the great light. In like manner, at the moment of
departing from this world, let a man declare his
contrition, and if he be unable, let his son, relative,
or those present, perform this rite of penance at
that time.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 330</span>
<span class="sc">Gate the fiftieth.</span> When a son or daughter
attains the age of fifteen, it becomes necessary to bind
the sacred cincture about the waist, as this forms
the bond of duty.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the fifty-first.</span> If a child should die, from
the first day of its decease during a space of seven
years, “without the expression of grief, recite the
Darún of its angel.” On the fourth night after
its decease, it is necessary to recite with <span class="title">Yasht</span>, the
Darún, or prayer of the angel Surúsh. Note, Yasht
is the name given to one of the twenty-one Nosks
of the
Zand,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_493" id="fnanchor_493"></a><a href="#footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a></span>
which is recited for the souls of the
deceased: this they also repeat in the <span class="title">Gahanbars:
Nosk</span> also signifies a part or section.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the fifty-second.</span> When thou placest on the
fire a cauldron for dressing food, it must be of a
large size, and two thirds of it without water, so
that when it boils, the water may not fall over on
the fire.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="gate53" id="gate53"></a><span class="sc">Gate the
fifty-third.</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_494" id="fnanchor_494"></a><a href="#footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a></span>
When they remove fire
<a name="Page_331" id="Page_331"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 331</span>
from one place to another, they lay it apart for a
short time, until its place becomes cool; having
taken care not to leave it heated, they bear the fire
to its destined place.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="gate54" id="gate54"></a><span class="sc">Gate the
fifty-fourth.</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_495" id="fnanchor_495"></a><a href="#footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a></span>
The true believers wash
the face every morning with the <dfn>Ab-í-zúr</dfn>, or “water
of power,” and afterwards with pure water.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_496" id="fnanchor_496"></a><a href="#footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a></span>
After this they recite the formula of the <span class="title">Kimna va
Mazda</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_497" id="fnanchor_497"></a><a href="#footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a></span>
and then wash the hands; this rite they call

the fruits they can find. The true believers then
continue to offer them up and to pray over them,
repeating the praises of the Lord, in order that their
condition may be improved that year; as on this day
the angels give nutriment to mankind. When any
one has thus prayed, the Amshaspand Khurdád
makes intercession for him: this prayer is synonymous

Astad (the angels of the 18th and 26th days of every

any intercourse with a courtesan or unchaste woman,
<a name="Page_338" id="Page_338"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 338</span>
also of voluntary degradation (connivance)
and adultery. For when a libertine engages in
improper correspondence with a woman, she becomes
an abomination to her husband; and if, after
proof of her misconduct, the husband resume his
intimacy with such a wife, he then becomes a <dfn>Rúspi</dfn>,
or utterly contemptible.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the seventieth.</span> If any one steal property
to the amount of one direm, they take from the
thief two direms, cut off the lobes of his ears, inflict

after one hour’s imprisonment. Should he a second
time commit a similar act, and steal to the amount
of a direm, they make him refund two, cut off his
ears, inflict twenty blows, and detain him in prison
two hours: should he after that steal three direms
or two dangs, they cut off his right hand; and if he
steal five hundred direms, they put him to death.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the seventy-first.</span> Beware of open and

Offer up thy grateful prayers to the Lord, the most
just and pure Ormuzd, the supreme and adorable
God, who thus declared to his prophet Zardusht:
“Hold it not meet to do unto others what thou
wouldst not have done to thyself: do that unto
the people which, when done to thyself, proves
not disagreeable to thyself.”</p>

<span class="sc">Gate the seventy-second.</span> Direct the Hirbud to
sanctify for thee an oblation or Darún once every

that Yazish has the sense of <span class="title">Yashtan</span>; also that <span class="title">Darún</span>
(the first letter with <span class="title">Zemma</span>) means a prayer in praise
of the Lord and of fire, which being recited by the
professors of the pure faith, they breathe over the
viands; whatever has been thus breathed over they
call <span class="title">Yashtah</span>: for <dfn>Yashtan</dfn> signifies the reciting of a

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the seventy-third.</span> Let women perform the

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the seventy-fourth.</span> Beware of committing
adultery; for when the wife of a stranger has been
four times visited by a strange man, she becomes
accursed to her husband: to put such a woman to
death is more meritorious than slaying beasts of

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the seventy-fifth.</span> A woman during her
illness is not to look at the fire, to sit in water, behold
the sun, or hold conversation with a man.
Two women, during their illness, are not to sleep
in the same bed, or look up to heaven. Women in
this state are to drink out of leaden vessels, and not
to lay their (bare) hands on bread. The drinking-vessel
<a name="Page_340" id="Page_340"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 340</span>
is to be half-filled with water, and not filled
up to the brim. They are to fold their hand in the
sleeve of their mantle and then lay hold of the vessel:
they must not sit in the sun. On the birth of a
child, the infant is to undergo ablution along with
the mother.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the seventy-sixth.</span> A fire is not to be lighted
in a situation exposed to the sun’s rays: also place
not over the fire any thing through the interstices of
which the sun may shine. But before the time of
Mah Abád it was held praiseworthy to light a fire
in face of the great luminary for the purpose of
making fumigations.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the seventy-seventh.</span> They show the Nisa

and again when they convey it
to the burial-place. When removing the body, the
<a name="Page_341" id="Page_341"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 341</span>
bearers fasten their hands together with a cord, so
that it comes to all their hands and keeps them close
to each other; they bear the body along in perfect
silence; and if the deceased be a woman advanced
in her pregnancy, there are then four bearers instead
of two. According to the precepts of Mah
Abád, if the woman be pregnant, they are to extract
the fœtus and bring it up: the same holds good respecting
all animals. Finally, when the professors
of the pure faith have conveyed the corpse to the
<dfn>Dad Gah</dfn>, or “place for depositing the dead,” the
bearers wash themselves and put on fresh garments.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the seventy-eighth.</span> It is necessary to beware
of (contact with) the wooden frame on which
the dead body has been carried or washed; also of

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the eighty-seventh.</span> If a woman be delivered
of a dead child previous to four months’ gestation,
as it is without a soul, it is not to be regarded
as a dead body; but should this occur after the term

body, and to be conveyed to burial with the usual
ceremonies.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the eighty-eighth.</span> When a death occurs,

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the ninety-first.</span> You must not put off the

and from thee to the resurrection
is a period of three thousand years: thus I have
created thee in the middle, as that point is most
worthy of admiration. Moreover I have rendered
obedient to thee king Gushtasp, the wisest
<a name="Page_345" id="Page_345"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 345</span>
and most prudent sovereign of the age; whose
eminence arises from science and perfect morals,
not merely from high birth and lineage. I have
also given thee a volume such as the <span class="title">Avesta</span>, and
in like manner a perspicuous commentary on it.
Expect not that, after thou hast passed away,
others will perform good works for thee. Know
that Gokhastah or Ahriman has expressly appointed
two demons, named Tardiness and Procrastination,

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Gate the ninety-fourth.</span> The <span class="title">Gáhámbars</span>, which
are six in number, must be observed, because the
Almighty created the world in six periods or times,
the commencement of each period having a particular
name; in order to celebrate each of which commencements,
they pass five days in festivity and rejoicing.
According to the statement in the <cite>Zand</cite>,
the righteous Hormuzd created the whole world in
the space of one year.</p>

<p><span class="title">The first Gáhámbar</span> is called <dfn>Mídúyzaram</dfn>, as on the
day <span class="title">Khúr</span> (the 11th of the month) <span class="title">Ardibehisht</span>, God
commenced the creation of the heavens, which was
terminated in forty-five days.</p>

<p><span class="title">The second Gáhambár</span>, called <dfn>Midyúshaham</dfn>, began on
the day of <span class="title">Khúr</span>, in the old month of <span class="title">Tir</span>, in sixty
<a name="Page_347" id="Page_347"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 347</span>
days from which God completed the creation of the
waters.</p>

<p><span class="title">The third Gáhambár, Pitishahím</span>, commences on the
day of <span class="title">Ashtád</span> (the 26th) of the old <span class="title">Shahrivár</span>, in seventy-five
days from which God terminated the creation
of the earth.</p>

<p><span class="title">The fourth Gáhambár</span>, called <dfn>Ayad sahrím</dfn>, begins on
the <span class="title">Ashtád</span> of the old month of <span class="title">Mihr</span>, in thirty days
from which the creation of all plants and trees was
completed.</p>

<p><span class="title">The fifth Gahambar</span>, named <dfn>Mídyárím</dfn>, begins on the
<span class="title">Miher</span> of the old month <span class="title">Ardí</span> (November); God created
from this day, in eighty days, all the animals.</p>

<p><span class="title">The sixth Gahambar, Hamshpata
mihdim</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_516" id="fnanchor_516"></a><a href="#footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a></span> beginning
on the day of <span class="title">Ahnavad</span>, the first of the five intercalary
or surreptitious days, reckoning from which the Almighty
terminated the creation of the human race
in seventy-five days. Tradition thus ascribes to
Jemshid the origin of the festival of the Gáhambár.
<a name="Page_348" id="Page_348"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 348</span>
In the <cite>Sad-Dár</cite> we find it recorded, that the demon
one day came to Jemshid’s palace, and the king, as
usual, sent him to the kitchen to satisfy his hunger.
The demon having devoured all that was there, and
also swallowed up whatever they brought him beside,
was still unsatisfied. On beholding this, Jemshid
cried out to the Lord, and the most righteous
God sent the angel Behrám (or Jabrael) to say thus
to the king: “Slaughter the red ox, on which pour
vinegar, rue, and garlic; take it when boiled out
of the cauldron, and serve it up to the demon.”
When they had done thus, the demon having tasted
one morsel of it, fled and disappeared, from which
day they instituted the festival of the <span class="title">Gáhambár</span>.</p>

<p>The Abádiyán say, with respect to the creation,
that the actions of God are not circumscribed by
time. It must however be acknowledged that Jemshid
first established this festival. In the first Gáhambár,
Jemshid, by the command of the Almighty,
began to depict on the ceiling of his palace the representation
of the heavens, which undertaking was
finished in forty-five days. Secondly, on the <span class="title">Khúr</span>
of <span class="title">Tír</span> he was commanded by the Lord to introduce
water into his palace, gardens, city, and cultivated
grounds, which work was completed in the course
of sixty days. Thirdly, on the <span class="title">Ashtád</span> of <span class="title">Shahrivár</span>,
by order of the Almighty (whose name be glorified!)
he cleared the surface of the grounds and palace,
<a name="Page_349" id="Page_349"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 349</span>
and embellished them exceedingly; he levelled the
place of exercise in front of his palace, built houses,
and laid out in due order the city and its streets; all
which was completed in seventy-five days. Fourthly,
on the <span class="title">Ashtád</span> of <span class="title">Mihr</span>, he began to ascertain the properties
of all vegetable productions, and completed
the embellishment of his garden, and terminated
the entire in thirty days. He next, on the day of
<span class="title">Mihr</span> in the month of <span class="title">Dáí</span>, collected all species of
animals in his garden and assigned their suitable
employments to each: to the ox and the ass to carry
burdens; to the horse to serve for riding, and so
forth; which arrangements were completed in seventy
days. Lastly, on the day of <span class="title">Ahnavad</span>, he summoned
mankind to appear in his presence, and assigned
them their respective occupations; the details
of which were finished in the course of seventy days.
He then proclaimed: “The Lord has created all
these things through me;” and commanded five
days to be set apart for rejoicing at the beginning
of each Gáhambár. As to the tradition of the demon’s
appearing and eating up whatever he found,
it is thus explained: by the demon is meant, the
depraved sensual appetite, which loves to eat, sleep,
shed blood, and such like, and is never satiated with
such pursuits; but when the spiritual Jemshid
prayed to the Lord, the Jabriel of intellect came
with this divine communication: “Slay the sensual
<a name="Page_350" id="Page_350"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 350</span>
appetite (which is typified by the ox), that is,
indulge it not in the excesses it demands; next
apply to the cauldron of the body the vinegar of
abstinence, the garlic of reflection, and the rue
of silence; then serve up a portion of this food to
the Satan-like propensities, that the demon may
flee away.” On doing this, he was delivered
from the presence of the evil one. Such was the
enigma propounded to the people by Zardusht respecting
the Gáhambár, and such the solution of it
as given by the Abádián professors, who have interpreted
in a similar manner the whole of Zardusht’s
discourses, which were couched under this enigmatical
form.</p>

stronger impressions. In the next place, if it were

idea of the existence of the necessarily existing God,
independent of cause, he could not understand the
<a name="Page_352" id="Page_352"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 352</span>
proposition; and if we speak to him concerning the
uncompoundedness of intelligences, the immateriality
of souls, the excellence of the sphere and stars,
he becomes overwhelmed in perplexity and amazement;
being utterly unable to comprehend spiritual
delights or tortures, or discover the exact truth;
whilst the precepts enforced by the figurative expressions
of the law come within the understanding of
high and low, so that they are profited thereby,
and the explanation of the law is attended with a
good reputation both in this world and the next.
The select few undoubtedly comprehend the nature
of certainty, religious abstraction, and philosophy,
although the vulgar, in general, hold these in abhorrence:
it therefore becomes necessary to clothe the
maxims of philosophy in the vestments of law, in
order that all classes of society may derive their
appropriate advantages from that source: these
observations being premised, it is to be remarked,
that some Yazdanian professors express themselves
after this manner:&mdash;The book of the <cite>Zend</cite> is of two
kinds; the one perspicuous and without enigmatical
forms of speech, which they call the <dfn>Mah Zand</dfn>, or
“Great Zand;” the second, abounding in enigmatical
and figurative forms of speech, is called the
<dfn>Kah Zand</dfn>, or “Little Zand.” The Mah Zand contained
the precepts of the law promulgated by the
venerable Máhábád, such as the volume of Azar
<a name="Page_353" id="Page_353"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 353</span>
Sassán, and the Mah Zand was lost during the domination
of strangers, particularly the Turks and
Greeks: the Kah Zand still remained, but much of
it was also lost in other subsequent invasions.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Summary of the contents of the Mah Zend.</span>&mdash;It
entitles the supreme Lord, Aharmuz, and acknowledges
the existence, immateriality, and uncompoundedness
of his essence; accounting <span class="title">Bahmán</span> the
Great, the first-created being, who is also called
<span class="title">Farvardín</span> the Great, and looked upon and styled
pure and uncompounded; from him was derived
<span class="title">Ardibehesht</span> the Great, along with the sublime soul
and body of the empyrean heaven; from <span class="title">Ardibehesht</span>
the Great proceeded <span class="title">Khurdád</span> the Great; from him
<span class="title">Tír</span> the Great; from him <span class="title">Murdád</span> the Great; from him
<span class="title">Shahrívar</span> the Great; from him <span class="title">Mihr</span> the Great; from
him <span class="title">Abán</span> the Great; from him <span class="title">Azar</span> the Great; and
from him <span class="title">Dai</span> the Great; these are the lords of the
heavens, and after <span class="title">Farvardin</span> the Great, are accounted
as the months as well as the heavens collectively.
In all other points, speculative and practical, such
as the protection of harmless creatures and the destruction
of noxious animals, it agrees with the <cite>Dasátir</cite>.
During the Ashkanian dynasty, the people
conformed to the <cite>Kah Zend</cite>, but as Ardeshir was
obedient to the second Sasán, he, in compliance
with the <cite>Dasátir</cite> and <cite>Mah Zend</cite>, studiously avoided
<a name="Page_354" id="Page_354"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 354</span>
the destruction of harmless animals: for the <cite>Mah
Zand</cite> is a portion of the <cite>Dasátir</cite>. After him, others
adopted the <cite>Kah Zand</cite>. But Nushirvan, under the
guidance of the contemporary <span class="title">Azar Sasán</span>, although
conforming to the <cite>Dasátir</cite> and <cite>Mah Zand</cite>, was during
the whole of his life innocent of the crime of slaying
harmless animals; his successors however followed
the precepts of the <cite>Kah Zend</cite>, until the fifth
Sasán,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_518" id="fnanchor_518"></a><a href="#footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a></span>
having uttered imprecations against the people of
Iran, they became the victims of privation and
wretchedness.</p>

<p>The professors of the Abadíán faith say that Ahriman
was produced by Time: they also say that the
angels and the heavens have existed, exist, and will
continue to exist.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_519" id="fnanchor_519"></a><a href="#footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a></span>
Moreover the belief of the <span class="title">Azar</span>
<a name="Page_355" id="Page_355"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 355</span>
<span class="title">Húshengíáns</span> or <span class="title">Yazdaníáns</span> is, that although the faith
of Zardusht prevailed universally from the time of
Gushtasp to that of Yezdejird, yet that the different
intervening princes glossed it over and made it agree
with the <span class="title">Azar Hushengíán</span> or <span class="title">Mahabadíán</span> system, so
as never to sanction the destruction of animal life;
and as they held the words of Zardusht to be figurative,
they never put them in practice literally when
they contradicted the <span class="title">Azar Hushengíán</span> faith, but
invariably glossed them over.</p>

<p><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 356</span>
This statement proves that <span class="person">Ardeshir Babegan</span> and
the other Sasáníán princes showed great reverence
to the <span class="person">Azar Sasáníán</span> family and paid them implicit
obedience, as being truly the ministers and worshippers
of the Lord; they besides accounted them
as the legitimate sovereigns, regarding themselves
merely as their lieutenants: in short, when the <span class="title">Azar
Sasáníáns</span> ceased to reign, they exercised the government
in their stead. However the <span class="title">Azar Sasáníáns</span>
followed no faith except that of Máhábád, receiving
no other without the requisite glosses, and
attaching no esteem whatever to the external import
of Zardusht’s precepts: that is, regarding his words
as true, but holding their external import as figurative.
The Behdiníáns also maintain that such was
the system adopted by the kings of old, particularly
by <span class="person">Dárá</span>, <span class="person">Dáráb</span>, <span class="person">Bahmán</span>,
<span class="person">Isfendiár</span>, and <span class="person">Lohrásp</span>.</p>

<p>The present seems the proper time for stating
some of the enigmatical sayings ascribed to the
Magians or followers of Zardusht, as philosophy is
guarded by such expressions from falling into the
hands of the ignorant, whilst the sages thereby
attain their object.</p>

<p>It is well known that according to their system
the world had two creators, <span class="title">Yazdan</span> (the Lord), and
<span class="title">Ahriman</span>: but the Lord having entertained this evil
thought, “Perhaps an antagonist may rise up to
oppose me,” Ahriman was produced, from that
<a name="Page_357" id="Page_357"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 357</span>
thought.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_520" id="fnanchor_520"></a><a href="#footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a></span>
In some places it is mentioned that God
was alone, and gloom having come over him, he
entertained an evil suspicion, on which Ahriman
was produced. They say that Ahriman, who was
outside the world, on looking through a small aperture,
and beholding the Lord surrounded with glory
and majesty, bore him envy and raised up wickedness
and corruption. God then created the angels
to be his host, and with them fought against Ahriman;
but being unable to destroy him, they made
peace with each other on this condition; that Ahriman
should remain in the world during a definite
period; and on his departure it should become the
abode of unalloyed
good.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_521" id="fnanchor_521"></a><a href="#footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a></span>
<a name="Page_358" id="Page_358"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 358</span>
Jamásp, the venerable sage, says thus: “It is to
be remarked that ‘<dfn>world</dfn>’ is a metaphorical expression
for body; and ‘<dfn>God</dfn>,’ for the aspiration
of the spirit; ‘<dfn>Ahriman</dfn>,’ for the physical temperament;
‘<dfn>the evil thought</dfn>,’ the habitual bias of the
soul to material objects; by ‘<dfn>the wickedness and
corruption of Ahriman, and his war</dfn>,’ are implied
the domination of the sensual passions over spirit;
and what they said of ‘<dfn>the terrestrial world</dfn>,’ means
the same; by ‘<dfn>the creation of angels</dfn>,’ the existence
of praiseworthy qualities and perseverance in pure
morals, with the subjugation of the senses by
means of religious austerities, for the senses constitute
the gratuitous foes of the heart; by ‘<dfn>peace</dfn>,’
is signified the impossibility of expelling by one
effort the evil propensities which are the armies of
Iblis; that is, excess and extravagance are to be
avoided, and the path of moderation followed;
the circumstance of ‘<dfn>Ahriman’s remaining in the
world for a definite period</dfn>,’ means the ascendancy
and supremacy of the bodily passions, particularly
in early years, and before arriving at mature reflection,
and even during other periods of this mortal
<a name="Page_359" id="Page_359"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 359</span>
life, in certain constitutions; ‘<dfn>the departure of Ahriman
from the world</dfn>’ implies voluntary death, or
religious austerities, or compulsory death, which
is the natural decease; when the soul has by such
means been emancipated, it finds itself adorned
with perfections and attains to its particular
sphere or bliss without alloy.”</p>

<p>They have said: “Darkness besieged Light and
imprisoned it; on which event the angels having
come to the assistance of Light, Darkness demanded
help from Ahriman, its source; but the
angels having overcome the prince of Darkness,
gave him a respite until the appointed hour
and the predestined death.” As to Darkness
having arisen from the evil thought of Light, the
venerable sage Jamasp says: “The interpretation
of this tradition is the same as that of the preceding;
as thus: The soul is a precious substance,
formed from light; its darkness, the bodily passions;
its confinement and imprisonment, the
dominion of the passions over that luminous
essence, which drag down the souls of the wicked
to the desolation of the lower world; the assistance
of angels, is the obtaining of grace and power
through elevation of mind, proceeding from illumination
from on high, and the ascent of the spirit
to the world of intellect; delay or respite implies
the continuance of the passions until the period of
<a name="Page_360" id="Page_360"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 360</span>
natural death; and the corrupt thought the bias
of the soul to material objects.”</p>

<p>Dáwar Haryár, the author of the <cite>Dáráí Sekandur</cite>,
having once questioned the author concerning the
enigmatical meanings attached to the words God
and Ahriman, received this answer: “Light is the
same as existence, and darkness signifies non-existence;
God is therefore light or existence, and
Ahriman is darkness or non-existence. When it
is said that Ahriman is opposed to God, the meaning
is, that God is existence, the opposite to which
is non-existence.”</p>

<p>They say that the creation and production of
diseases, serpents, scorpions, and such like is an
abominable act, originating with Ahriman, which
Jamásp thus explains: “It is evident that diseases,
such as ignorance, folly, pride, negligence, noxious
creatures, (such as) anger, lust, strong passions,
concupiscence, calumny, envy, malignity, covetousness,
treachery, fraud, and the like, arise not
from spirit, but from the elemental constitution.”
They have also said: “An angel is the agent of
good, and Ahriman the agent of evil; and that
God is exempt from both these acts; which the
celebrated sage Jamásp thus explains:&mdash;By angel
is implied spirit and the agent of good; which, if
it overcome the senses, engages man in virtuous
words and acts, which are styled ‘good.’ Ahriman,
<a name="Page_361" id="Page_361"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 361</span>
or Satan, in this place means the desires inherent
in the constitution of the senses, which, on
obtaining the victory over spirit, attract it towards
the pleasures of sense, thus making it forget
its original abode; which is denominated
‘evil:’ and as the Almighty has given his creatures
free will, neither are their good or evil deeds to be
imputed to him.” This saying: That the soul of
him who has done evil, having determined on flight
through fear of divine wrath, plunges downwards,
is thus explained by the sage Jamasp: “By ‘<dfn>sinner</dfn>’
is understood one whose essence is defective;
by ‘<dfn>descent</dfn>,’ turning away from the superior
to corporeal attachments; by ‘<dfn>resolving on flight</dfn>,’
the strong desires of passion, through the suggestion
of body, until the entire departure of divine
grace.”</p>

<p>Thus far extend the illustrations of the sage Jamásp.
But that the scope of Zardusht is couched
under allegories agrees with the declaration made
by the great Bahman, the son of Isfendiár, the son
of king Gushtásp, who says: “Zardusht once said
to me: ‘My father and mother delivered me to
nurses, who dwelt in a place far remote from
the city of my birth; with these I remained many
a long year, until I quite forgot my father, mother,
and native town. Suddenly this thought
came over my mind&mdash;Who are my parents,
<a name="Page_362" id="Page_362"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 362</span>
and where the place of my birth?&mdash;I struggled
hard until I returned naked and bare the way by
which I had come; and having gained my house
and beheld my father and mother, I returned
again to the place where my nurses dwelt. As
the dress worn by the people of this country
was on my person, I shall therefore remain
here until this dress is worn out, and then depart,
in order that it may not be said&mdash;He was
unable to perform his office and has run away,
leaving our despised garments.’”</p>

<p>Bahman, the son of Isfendiár, thus says: “All
that Zardusht uttered was enigmatical: the ‘<dfn>city
and native place</dfn>’ are the angelic world; by ‘<dfn>father</dfn>,’
is meant the primary intelligence; and by ‘<dfn>mother</dfn>,’
the universal soul; ‘<dfn>the nurses</dfn>,’ this lower world
and junction with body; ‘<dfn>forgetting the original
abode</dfn>,’ attachment to the elements of body;
‘<dfn>recalling it to memory</dfn>,’ implies the struggle towards
that direction; ‘<dfn>the arriving there</dfn>,’ means
religious austerities; ‘<dfn>the state of nakedness</dfn>,’ the
divesting one’s self of bodily attachments; ‘<dfn>the
returning back to the nurses</dfn>,’ means resuming the
body; ‘<dfn>that it may not be said that he was alarmed
at the performance of duty, and ran off, leaving his
clothes behind; I shall not therefore depart from
hence, until these clothes be worn out</dfn>;&mdash;<dfn>the performance
of duty</dfn>,’ signifies the amassing of the
<a name="Page_363" id="Page_363"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 363</span>
capital of knowledge, true faith, and good works;
by ‘<dfn>the clothes being worn out</dfn>,’ is implied the separation
of the bodily members; that is, I will remain
here as long as the body lasts, and after its
dissolution return to my native place.”</p>

<p>Prince Isfendiár, the son of king Gushtásp, also
tells us: “Zardusht once said to me: ‘A number
of persons once left their native place for the purpose
of acquiring wealth, that on their return
they might pass their time in pleasure and enjoyment.
On arriving at the city of their destination,
some of them amassed wealth; some devoted
themselves to wandering about the place
and contemplating the beauties with which it
abounded; whilst others remained altogether
inactive. When the time of packing up came,
the king of that people said&mdash;Depart from hence,
that another set may arrive, and obtain their
portion, as you have done.&mdash;On which all these
people went out, some provided with stores for
the journey; some without any provision; a few
on horseback; a multitude on foot; a wide desert
lay before, and a toilsome road, through
rocks and prickly thorns, devoid of cultivation,
destitute of water and shade. Those who were
on horseback and furnished with provisions
passed over, and having reached their native
city, gave themselves up to joy and gladness;
<a name="Page_364" id="Page_364"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 364</span>
those who were on foot, and had provided stores
for the journey, after experiencing many ups
and downs, at last, with extreme difficulty,
reached their halting place, where they passed
their time in a state of happiness proportioned
to their gains, although, on instituting a comparison
between themselves and those inhabitants
and dignified persons who had acquired
opulence by commercial pursuits, they feel pangs
of regret; but those who came out of the city
without any kind of conveyance or stores, and
thinking that without supplies they could reach
their native place, when they had gone some
little distance, became wearied and unable to
proceed through weakness, and fatigue from
walking, want of provisions, the difficulties of
the road, distress, the sun’s overpowering heat,
and the gloom of night; they were forced by
necessity to turn back to the city, where they
had been; but other merchants had in the meantime
taken possession of the houses, dwellings,
shops, and apartments which they formerly
occupied: they were thus reduced to a state of
destitution, and had no resource left but that of
working for hire or turning mendicants, pursuits
which they adopted.’”</p>

<p>Isfendiar says: “‘<dfn>The city from which they departed
for the purposes of commerce</dfn>’ is the angelic world;
<a name="Page_365" id="Page_365"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 365</span>
<dfn>that to which they came with the design of accumulating
wealth</dfn>’ is the lower world; ‘<dfn>the houses,
shops, etc.</dfn>,’ signify the human body; ‘<dfn>the people
of the city</dfn>’ are the animals, vegetables, and minerals;
‘<dfn>the king</dfn>,’ the elemental nature; ‘<dfn>what the
merchants have amassed</dfn>’ are their words and deeds;
‘<dfn>what others have collected</dfn>’ is devotion without
knowledge; ‘<dfn>the inactive</dfn>’ are those whose only
“pursuits were sleep, sensual gratification, etc.;
‘<dfn>the exclamation of the king</dfn>’ is Death, who expels
them from the mansions of body; ‘<dfn>the deserts and
mountains</dfn>,’ the extremes of heat and cold; ‘<dfn>the
equestrians</dfn>’ are those who unite the speculative
and practical; ‘<dfn>the pedestrians, who were furnished
with some provisions</dfn>’ are those who adore God,
but neither knew themselves nor the Lord; ‘<dfn>they
who are without provisions or conveyance</dfn>’ are those
destitute of knowledge and good works, who
being unable to reach the angelic world, return in
despair to the elemental world, forfeiting the rank
they once possessed.”</p>

<p>The sage <span class="person">Shah Nasir Khusran</span> says on this head:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“When any one travels this road for that important purpose,</div>
  <div class="i0">He takes at least a loaf of bread under his arm:</div>
  <div class="i0">How then canst thou, who hast no store, proceed up the mount,</div>
  <div class="i0">From the centre of darkness to the zenith of Saturn?”</div>
 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>In some other parables of Zardusht, which are
here noticed, he speaks thus: “When the travellers,
<a name="Page_366" id="Page_366"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 366</span>
in consequence of the want of stores and fatigue
of walking, return back to the king’s city, not
finding their former beautiful mansions, they settle
themselves in caverns or lanes, hiring themselves
as labourers or subsisting on alms.”</p>

<p>Esfendiar says: “By this is understood, that when
they quit this mortal frame, they cannot reach the
world on high, owing to their want of knowledge
and good works; being thus rejected, on
their return to the elemental world, they cannot
obtain human bodies, but are invested with the
forms of the brute creation.” As this parable
nearly resembles what has been heretofore mentioned,
it is unnecessary to describe it more in
detail.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“When thou departest from the inn of the body, there is no other storehouse;</div>
  <div class="i0">Why dost thou not therefore procure supplies for the road in this place of sojourn?”</div>
 </div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>Isfendiar also records: “Zardusht once said:
‘Two persons of one house were partners, and
were both possessed of great capital; they said:&mdash;We
have gained a sufficient stock of wealth
in the world, and live and dress in a manner
suitable to our great riches; we now only want
some beloved object, that our existence may be
more blissful: therefore, to attain our desire, it
will be necessary to undertake a journey. They
<a name="Page_367" id="Page_367"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 367</span>
directed their course to a city, the inhabitants
of which were famed for beauty and gracefulness;
on arriving there with the caravan, one
of the partners gave himself up to traversing the
gardens, and was so absorbed in admiring the
beauties of the city, that he attended to no
business whatever, whilst the other partner
obtained a mistress of exquisite beauty. All of
a sudden the garden-door was closed.’”</p>

<p>Isfendiar says “<dfn>Záíd</dfn> and
<dfn>Amru</dfn><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_522" id="fnanchor_522"></a><a href="#footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a></span>
may serve as an
example of the two friends; ‘<dfn>the capital and stock</dfn>,’
the original world; ‘<dfn>the city of beauteous persons</dfn>,’
this world; ‘<dfn>the desirable beloved object</dfn>,’ good works;
‘<dfn>the rapacious animals, reptiles, and beasts</dfn>’ are
anger, lust, excessive desire, hatred, envy, concupiscence,
malignity, and avarice; ‘<dfn>the herbage
and gardens</dfn>’ are sloth and pride; ‘<dfn>the garden-door</dfn>,’
the dakhmah (or sepulchral vault); ‘<dfn>the
urn</dfn>,’ the grave, or the place of burying the dead;
‘<dfn>shutting the garden-door</dfn>’ the moment of death.”</p>

<p>His reasons for enumerating the urn, dakhmah,
and grave are, that according to the faith of Azur
Húshang, or Máhábád, they sometimes put the body
of the deceased into a jar of aqua-fortis, as among
them the body is deposited indifferently either in the
dakhmah or the jar: but the sepulchre is in use
<a name="Page_368" id="Page_368"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 368</span>
among the people of Room, and the funeral pile
among those of Hindustan.</p>

<p>King Gushtásp also relates the following parable
of Zardusht: “A certain man delivered his son
to a preceptor, saying: ‘Within such a time teach
this boy the accomplishments necessary for a
courtier.’ The boy, however, through a fondness
for pleasure, sport, and amusements, was
unwilling to give himself any trouble, and was
slow in learning any thing; he however every
day secretly brought from home sweetmeats and
agreeable objects, as his tutor had a great inclination
for such enjoyments. When the preceptor’s
time had passed in this manner, and his pupil had
become habituated to revelling, sensual pleasures,
and enjoyments, the tutor at last fell dangerously
indisposed through these excesses, and laid himself
down on the bed of death. His pupil well
knew he had no other place left, and that he
must return to his parents, so that when his
master fell sick, he became sensible of his own
state. Through dread of his father, shame of his
mother, the disgrace of ignorance, and a sense of
contrition, he went not near them, but pined in
melancholy and wandered about in obscurity.”</p>

<p>This parable has been thus explained by Gushtásp:
“‘<dfn>The preceptor</dfn>’ signifies the five senses; ‘<dfn>the
son</dfn>,’ the immortal spirit; ‘<dfn>the father</dfn>,’ the universal
<a name="Page_369" id="Page_369"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 369</span>
intelligence; ‘<dfn>the mother</dfn>,’ the universal soul; ‘<dfn>the
sweetmeats and mistresses</dfn>,’ worldly enjoyments;
‘<dfn>the indispensable necessity of the immortal spirit</dfn>,’ that
it should, through the senses and the common
reflection which is their instructor, attain the
objects of intellect and amass provisions for its
return, so that it may become the associate of the
only true king. If this purpose be not effected,
it of course feels terror at the death of the body.
When it has become thus biassed to sensual pleasures
and devoid of all goodness, on being separated
from the body, although still possessed of
sufficient energy for mounting on high, yet through
shame and confusion, it feels no desire of arriving
there and beholding its parents, soul and intellect.”</p>

<p>The venerable Húryár once said to the author:
“I have seen the following narrative in the <cite>Ramazastán</cite>
of Zardusht: ‘The prime minister to the
sovereign of the world had so many sons, that
their number surpassed all computation; these he
first sent to a place of education, where, along
with the children of Rayas (cultivators), they
might attain knowledge. If the minister’s sons
became intelligent, the Dustúr summoned them
to his presence, and enrolled them among the
king’s confidential servants; but if they remained
without science, they were not regarded as the
<a name="Page_370" id="Page_370"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 370</span>
Vizir’s sons, but classed among the Rayas; were
not permitted to come into his presence; and
were cut off from all share in their father’s inheritance.”</p>

<p>The author replied: “It occurs to me that, by
‘<dfn>the king of the world</dfn>,’ is meant the supreme God
without equal; by ‘<dfn>vizir</dfn>,’ the primary intelligence;
and by ‘<dfn>the sons of the vizir</dfn>,’ the souls
endowed with reason; by ‘<dfn>school</dfn>,’ the elemental
world, and the bodies formed of the elements;
and by ‘<dfn>the children of the common people</dfn>’ the corporeal
senses and passions.”</p>

<p>When the immortal spirits have acquired knowledge
in this place of education, their father, “Universal
Intelligence,” brings them near himself,
and advances them to the rank of holding intercourse
with the Lord of Eternity: but the souls
which do not acquire knowledge in this school are
not allowed access to the world of uncompounded
beings, the abode of the Universal Intelligence, and
remain banished from the presence of the Creator of
the world; so that they make no advance from the
material bodies of this abode of the elements, which
hold the rank of Rayas, but are excluded from all
share in the inheritance of the primary intelligence
or the acquisition of knowledge.</p>

<p>Zardusht has also said: “In the upper regions
there exists a mighty ocean, from the vapors of
<a name="Page_371" id="Page_371"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 371</span>
which a great mirage appears in this lower world:
so that nothing save that illusion subsists here;
exactly as nothing besides that ocean exists in the
world on high.”</p>

<p>The revered ruler of Húryár, having asked the
author the meaning of this parable, received this
answer: “‘<dfn>The mighty ocean</dfn>’ means the absolute
essence and pure existence of God; ‘<dfn>the mirage</dfn>’
implies contingent existences, which in truth
exist not, but appear to do so, through the
inherent property of God’s absolute existence;
according to this view, he has said: ‘From
the vapors of that ocean has arisen the mirage.’”</p>

<p>It is recorded in the books composed by Zardusht’s
followers, and also in the ancient histories
of Iran, that at the period of Arjásp’s second invasion
of Balkh, king Gushtasp was partaking of the
hospitality of Zál, in Sistan, and Isfendiar was a
prisoner in Dazh Gambadán; and that Lohorásp,
notwithstanding the religious austerities he performed
through divine favor, laid aside the robes of
mortality in battle, after which the Turks took the
city. A Turk named <span class="person">Turbaratur</span>, or <span class="person">Turbaraturhash</span>,

 If the claims to originality and antiquity of the language in which the
Desátir is written were admitted, we should have (<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 146, 147,
<abbr title="English translation">Engl.
transl.</abbr>) <span class="person">Hertushád</span> or <span class="person">Hertúrásh</span>,
as the first and true name of the Persian
prophet who followed immediately Kái Khusro. In Zand, upon which language
we are now better informed, the true name of this legislator of the
Persians is <span class="person">Zerethoshtró</span>, or <span class="person">Zarathustra</span>,
which signifies “star of gold;”
of this was formed in the Pehlevi language the name of <span class="title">Zaratesht</span> or
<span class="title">Zaratosht</span>, and in Farsi that of <span class="title">Zardúsht</span>
or <span class="title">Zaradusht</span>. The Greeks
have changed the original Zand name, either by removing the “th” in
the middle of it, and thus making it <span class="title">Zereoshtró</span>,
<span class="title">Zoroastrés</span>; or by
omitting the final syllable “tro,” whence it became <span class="title">Zaratos</span>,
<span class="title">Zabratos</span>,
<span class="title">Zaradas</span>, <span class="title">Zarasdés</span>,
<span class="title">Zathraustés</span>; we find, moreover, <span class="title">Zoromasdrès</span>,
<span class="title">Azonaces</span>, and <span class="title">Nazaratús</span>.
The most ancient mention of the name of
Zoroastrès, in Greek books, is to be found in the works of Plato, and
dates therefore from the fourth century before our era. The original
word has been translated by ἀστροδύτης, “he who sacrifices to the stars;”
by <span lang="el" xml:lang="el">ἀστροδέατης</span> “he who contemplates the stars;”
and by “living star.”
These interpretations relate to the character of a priest and of an astronomer,
generally attributed to Zoroaster, who is also believed to have
been the inventor of <em>magic</em>; this word was originally taken in a sense
very different from that which has been given to it in later times, and can
be referred to the name of <span class="title">Magi</span>, or <span class="title">Mobeds</span>
(see <a href="#footnote_233">note</a>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 17), well known
to Herodotus in the fifth century B. C. These Magi are represented as the
teachers and priests of a most pure philosophy and religion, the origin of
which is placed by the Desátir and the Dabistán in the most remote and
ante-historical times of the Máhábádiáns. It may therefore appear less
surprising to find in Pliny’s Natural History (<abbr title="One thirty chapter">I.
xxx. c.</abbr> 1. 2.) Zoroaster
placed, pursuant to the authority of Aristotle and Eudoxus, 6000 years
before the death of Plato, and, conformably to Hermippus, 5000 years
before the Trojan war. The last date is repeated by Plutarch (lib. de Is.
et Osir.). Diogenes Laertius says: “Hermodoros, a Platonic philosopher,
counts 5000 years from the establishment of the Magi to the destruction
of Troy.” According to Suidas, a Zoroaster lived 500 years before the
Trojan war; if the number 500 had been erroneously substituted for
5000, which is admissible (see <abbr title="Monsieur" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M.</abbr>
de Fortia d’Urban, <cite>Mathématiciens
illustres</cite>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 354), we should have the agreement of all these creditable
authors just mentioned, from the fourth century before, to the twelfth
century after, our era, in fixing the age of Zoroaster and the establishment
of the Magi, 6352 or 6194 years B. C.</p>

<p class="footnote">The epocha of the Magi (putting aside that of the Máhábádiáns) has also
been taken for that of Tahmuras and Jemshid, that is, 3460 or 3429 years
B. C. According to other accounts (collected in the Hist. Diction. of Moreri,
Bayle, etc., etc.), a Zoroaster ruled the Bactrian empire in the times
of Ninus, the Assyrian king, 2200 years B. C.; vanquished by the latter,
he desired to be consumed by the fire of heaven, and exhorted the Assyrians
to preserve his ashes as a palladium of their empire; after he
had been killed by lightning, his last will was executed. Some historians
(see Herbelot <span class="decoration" lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub voce</span>) admit a Zerdúsht in the age of Feridún, 1729
years B. C. Several other learned men concur in placing him much later,
few below the sixth century before our era.</p>

<p class="footnote">In the utter impossibility to decide upon so many conflicting statements,
there is perhaps no better means of reconciling them all, than concluding
that Zoroaster having, in the course of ages, become a generic or appellative
name for sages, prophets, and kings professing and promoting a
certain religion or philosophy, this name could be applied to several individuals
who appeared at different times, and in different countries of Asia.
Hence we explain in the various accounts a plurality of Zoroasters, and an
identity of several personages with one Zoroaster; he has indeed been supposed
to be the same with <span class="person">Japhet</span>, <span class="person">Ham</span>
(<span class="person">Heemo</span>), <span class="person">Zohak</span>,
<span class="person">Nimrod</span>, <span class="person">Buddha</span>,
<span class="person">Abraham</span>, <span class="person">Moses</span>,
<span class="person">Ezekiel</span>, <span class="person">Balâam</span>, etc., etc. Whatever it be, the Dabistán
treats in this chapter of the Zardúsht, who appeared under the
reign of Gushtasp, king of Persia, upon whose epocha too our chronologers
are not unanimous.</p>

<p class="footnote">Independently of the Dasátir, written originally in a particular language,
the Persians have Zand books which they attribute to the last
Zoroaster himself. Except these works, the age of which is a subject of
dispute, they have no written records of their great legislator prior to the
ninth or tenth century of our era, and these are the poems of Dakiki and
Ferdusi. The latter narrates, in his Shah-nameh, the history of Zerdúsht
under the reign of Gushtasp. We have besides a Shah nameh <span class="title">naser</span>, or a
Shah-nameh in prose, composed by some one of the Magi (<cite>Hyde</cite>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 324).
The <span class="title">Zardusht-nameh</span>, and the <span class="title">Changragatcha-nameh</span> are Persian poems,
the epocha of which, according to Anquetil du Perron (<cite>Zend-Avesta</cite>, <abbr title="tome One pages">t. I.

 According to Cedrenus, an author of the eleventh century, Zoroaster
descended from Belus or Nimrod: this king is, by some authors,
identified with Zohák, who married two daughters of Djemchid, from
whom also Faridun descended; on account of this relationship, Zoroaster’s
origin may without contradiction be referred to Belus and to Faridun.
In the Desâtir, the name of his father is <span class="title">Heresfetmád</span>.

simply <span class="trans">Asta</span> and <span class="trans">zand</span>.</p>

<p class="footnote">Herbelot has interpreted this name of Zoroaster’s writings by “the
book of life.” Hyde thought (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 336) that
<span class="title">Zand Avesta</span> was properly
<span class="title">Zand va Esta</span>, or <span class="title">Zand u Esta</span>,
and <span class="title">Zand</span>, an Arabic word signifying
“igniarium, focile, pixis ignaria,” joined to the Hebrew-Chaldaic word
<span class="trans">Eshta</span>, or <span class="trans">Esta</span>, “ignis,”
and explained the whole name by “igniarium”
and “ignis,” or “tinder and fire.” According to Anquetil du Perron
(<cite>Zend-Avesta</cite>, <abbr title="tome Two page">t. II. p.</abbr> 423),
<dfn>zand</dfn> signifies “living,” and <span class="title">Avesta</span>, “word;”
therefore <span class="title">Zand-Avesta</span>, “the living word;” which was anciently the law
of the countries limited by the Euphrates, the Oxus, and the Indian
ocean (<cite>ibid.</cite>, <abbr title="tome one page 14">t. I. p. xiv</abbr>).
This law or religion is still professed by the
descendants of the Persians who, conquered by the Muhammedans, have
not submitted to the Koran; they partly inhabit Kirman, and partly the
western coast of India, to the north and south of Surat. It is besides
now decided by the investigations of the above-named author, and by those
of Kleuker, Rask, as well as by those of Messrs. Eugene Burnouf, Bopp,
Lassen, and other philologers, that Zand was an ancient language derived
from the same source as the Sanskrit; it was spoken before the
Christian era, particularly in the countries situated to the west of the
Caspian sea, namely in Georgia, Iran proper, and Azerbijan (the northern
Media). Moreover the <dfn>Pa-zand</dfn> denotes a dialect derived from the Zand,
or a mixed Zand, similar to the Rabbinic language of the Jews (<cite><abbr title="Zand-Avesta">Z.-Av.</abbr></cite>,
<abbr title="tome Two pages">t. II. pp.</abbr> 67, 68).</p>

<p class="footnote">It is generally known that Anquetil du Perron brought, in the year 1762,
from Surat in India, and deposited in the Royal library of Paris, several
Zand, Pehlvi, and Persian works, which, according to his opinion, were
partly the original works written by Zoroaster himself, partly translated, or
at least derived from original works of the Persian prophet. These writings,
namely <span class="title">The Vendidad</span>, in Zand and Pehlvi, were brought about the year
1276, by the Dostur Ardeshir, from Sistan to Guzerat, and there communicated
to the Parsees, who made two copies of them; from these come all
the <span class="title">Vendidads</span>, Zand and Pehlvi, of Guzerat. These works, parts of which
only existed in England, were then for the first time translated into an
European language, and published in French by Anquetil. Examined as
monuments of an ancient religion and literature of the Persians, they
have been differently appreciated by learned men, and their authenticity
denied by some, among whom the most conspicuous are sir William
Jones, Richardson, and Meiners, and defended by others, by none with
more zeal than John Frederic Kleuker, who not only translated Anquetil’s
<span class="title">Zand-Avesta</span> into German, in three volumes, but in an appendix of two
volumes (all in quarto) commented and discussed with great judgment,
sagacity, and erudition, all that relates to the Zand-books attributed to
Zoroaster. Here follow, as shortly as possible, the principal results of
his laborious investigations:&mdash;testimonies of the existence of works attributed
to Zoroaster are found in Greek authors who lived before our era.
It was in the sixth century B. C. that the Persian religion and philosophy
became known in Europe by Hostanes, the Archimagus who accompanied
Xerxes in his expedition against Greece. In the fourth century B. C., Plato,
Aristotle, and Theopompus show a knowledge of Zoroaster’s works. In
the third century B. C., Hermippus treats expressly of them, as containing
not less than 120,000 distichs. Soon after the beginning of the Christian
era, works attributed to Zoroaster are mentioned under different names
by Nicolaus of Damascus, Strabo, Pausanius, Pliny, and Dion Chrysostomus.
St. Clement of Alexandria, in the third century, was not unacquainted
with them. Later, the Gnostics made a great use of the oriental
cosmogony and psychology as derived from Zoroaster. The testimony of
Eusebius establishes that, in the fourth century, there existed a collection
of sacred works respecting the theology and religion of the Persians. It
was mostly the liturgical part of them that was spread about, mixed with
notions relative to the magical art. The empress Eudokia of the fifth,
and Suidas of the twelfth, century, attribute to Zoroaster several books,
four of which treat of nature, one of precious stones, and five of astrology
and prognostics. So much and more can be gathered from Greek and
Latin works about the writings of the Persian legislator.</p>

<p class="footnote">The records of the Muhammedans concerning them begin only in the
ninth century, by Muhammed Abu Jafar Ebn Jerir el Tabari (Hyde, 317-319),
according to whom Zoroaster wrote his revelations upon 12,000 cow-skins
(or parchment folios). Abu Muhammed Mustapha, in his life of Gushtasp,
says: “Zoroaster wrote the just-mentioned work in 12 tomes, each of which
formed a bullock’s load.” Both authors say that the Persian king deposited
these books, magnificently ornamented, in Istakhar. By several other
authors, from the ninth to the seventeenth century, it is positively established
that the books of the Zand-Avesta existed in all the centuries in
which the Muhammedans had intercourse with the disciples of Zartusht.
Works composed by the latter are: the <span class="title">Bun-Dehesh</span>, the <span class="title">Viraf-nameh</span>,
the <span class="title">Sad-der Bun-Dehesh</span>, the <span class="title">Ulemai-Islam</span>,
the <span class="title">Ravacts</span> (that is, the
correspondence between the Dosturs of Persia and India since the fifteenth
century), the <span class="title">Zaratusht nameh</span>, the
<span class="title">Changragachah namah</span>, and the history
of the flight of the Parsees to India. In all these works breathes the
spirit of the strongest conviction that authentic works of Zartusht have,
although not entirely, yet partly, been preserved to later days. This
conviction is common to a numerous nation, who adhere to their sacred
books as to the inappreciable inheritance of their forefathers. The generality
of this sentiment is attested by several respectable and intelligent
European travellers in the East, such as Henry Lord, Gabriel de Chinon,
J. B. Tavernier, D. Sanson, the chevalier Chardin, and others.</p>

<p class="footnote">The name of <span class="title">Zand-Avesta</span> belongs,
among the books published by Anquetil,
exclusively to those the original of which is truly Zand; these alone are
canonical; they are five in number, all theological, for the most part liturgical,
namely: 1. the <span class="title">Izechné</span>, “elevation of the soul, praise, devotion;”
called also <span class="title">the little Avesta</span>; 2. the
<span class="title">Vispered</span>, “the chiefs of the beings
there named;” 3. the <span class="title">Vendidad</span>, which is considered as the foundation
of the law (these three are called together the <span class="title">Vendidad Sadé</span>, “to combat
Ahriman”) 4. the <span class="title">Yeshts Sades</span>, or “a collection of compositions and
of fragments, more or less ancient;” 5. the book <span class="title">Siroz</span>, “thirty days,”
containing praises addressed to the Genius of each day: it is a sort of
liturgical calendar. These are the Zand-books existing in our days; the
originals of them are said by the learned Foucher to have been composed
under the reign of Gushtasp, whom he places before the time assigned to
Darius Hystaspes, whilst Anquetil and other modern authors identify
under these names a king of Persia, who lived about the middle of the
sixth century before our era. We may reasonably believe that the Zand-books
were written at a time when the Zand was a living, nay the dominant
language, in those countries where these books first appeared; that
is, in Georgia, in Iran, and in Azerbijan. Now, if it be admitted that the
Zand was in these countries quite a dead language already, under the
Ashkanian dynasty of Persia (the Arsacides), the first of whom, <span class="person">Aghush</span>,
began to reign 310 years B. C., it will follow, that the Zand-books were
written long before that time, that is, most likely at least, so early so the
sixth century before the Christian era.</p>

<p class="footnote">Besides the original Zand-books, Anquetil translated also from the
modern Persian the <span class="title">Bun-Dehesh</span>. This is a collection of treatises upon
several points, ranged under 34 sections&mdash;a sort of encyclopædia, theological,
cosmological, historical, and political. This work is written in
Pehlvi, and believed to be the translation of a Zand original no more
to be found in India. It is the most ancient of the modern works of the
Parsees, and was written probably about the seventh century of our era.</p>

<p class="footnote">What may confirm us in the opinion that these books, still in the hands
of the Parsees, are truly derived from much more ancient works is, that
their contents agree in a great number of principal points with the doctrine
attributed to the Magi and to Zoroaster by ancient Greek authors, of
whom the later Parsees had certainly not the least knowledge, whilst
their Zand-books contain the names of the first and most ancient kings of
the Medes and Persians, and no other but those, of whom the Greeks
knew nothing. No king and no private person, after Gushtasp and
Zoroaster, are mentioned in the Zand-books.</p>

<p class="footnote">Sixty years had elapsed since the publication of the Zand-Avesta by
Anquetil, when M. Eugène Burnouf undertook a revision and commentary
of that part of the Zand-works which the first had translated and
published, under the Pehlvi name of <span class="title">Iseshné</span>, and which, in Zand, is
entitled <span class="title">Yasna</span>. Among the manuscripts which Anquetil had brought
from India was a Sanskrit translation, made towards the end of the fifteenth
century by a Dostur called Neriosengh, probably from a Pehlvi
version of a Zand original. M. Eugène Burnouf, to give a better interpretation
of the Zand text, not only availed himself of the double translation,
executed by Neriosengh and Anquetil, but also, independently of
both, applied the principles of comparative philology to the analysis of
many Zand-words, the true signification of which he fixed, and by various
judicious observations, interspersed in his commentary, threw light upon
the geography, history, and religion of ancient Persia. He published in
1833 the first volume of his work, under the title “Commentaire sur le
Yasna:” he had before (1829) published the lithographed Zand text of
it in one folio volume. In 1836 appeared, at Bombay, a lithographed
edition of the same Zand text.”&mdash;<abbr title="Anthony Troyer">A. T.</abbr></p>

 The Amshásfands are the six first celestial spirits after Ormuzd.
Their name is derived from the Zand-words <dfn>emeshe</dfn>, “immortal,” and
<dfn>sepente</dfn>, “excellent, perfect.”&mdash;<abbr title="Anthony Troyer">A. T.</abbr></p>

 It is generally acknowledged that Ahriman was the author of evil,
opposed to Ormuzd, the creator and promoter of every good; but different
opinions are entertained upon the origin of these two mighty beings.
According to the most ancient doctrine, both were the productions of a
primordial cause, which is called <dfn>Zaruam akarenê</dfn>, “the boundless time.”
The Zand-books, as well as Shahristani and the Ulemi Islam, make Ahriman
anterior to Ormuzd, that is to say, in plain language, “the evil was
before the good.” These two were, however, not distinguished from
each other before Ahriman had become jealous of Ormuzd, for which he
was condemned by the great creator Time to dwell in the abode of darkness
for twelve thousand years. It was then only that Ormuzd saw with
horror his deformed and frightful adversary, and to oppose the effects of
his existence created, within three thousand years, a celestial region and
a celestial people. Ahriman, long time ignorant of what was preparing
against him, had scarce perceived the light of Ormuzd, when he ran to
destroy it, but, amazed at its beauty, fled back to hell, where he hastened
to produce a host of evil beings. In vain did Ormuzd offer reconciliation
to Ahriman, and even a partnership in the priesthood of the boundless
time; the fiend rejected all terms of peace, and war began to rage
between them (see <abbr title="Zend-Avesta, tome Two, pages"><cite>Zend-Av.</cite>, t. II. pp.</abbr> 345, 347.)</p>

<p class="footnote">According to the books of the Parsees and of the Muhammedans who
give an account of their doctrine, Ahriman is bad by nature: nor do the
more ancient Zand-books say that he ever was good; yet the explanation
given about this mysterious being can but involve contradictions in more
than one respect. He alone is able to resist Ormuzd, of whom his existence
is entirely independent; he is the king of the beings which he has
created, and which Ormuzd cannot annihilate; nor can the latter prevent
the effects of the power by which his enemy destroys the people of the
just, and banishes the moral good from the earth.</p>

<p class="footnote">An account of Ahriman’s origin, somewhat different from this, will be
seen hereafter in the Dabistán.&mdash;<abbr title="Anthony Troyer">A. T.</abbr></p>

 Zoroaster, according to the concurring account of several authors,
retired from the world and lived in a cavern of the mountain Alborz, or
in the mountains of Balkhan. According to the Rauzat us Sufa (Shea’s
<abbr title="translation, page">transl., p.</abbr> 286) it was in the
mountains near Ardebil, a city of Azarbijan
(the ancient Media). This cavern is said to have been consecrated by him
to Mithra. Pliny states (<abbr title="Naturalis Historia, liber eleven, chapter">H. N.
l. xi. c.</abbr> 42), the prophet lived 20 years in
deserts, upon cheese so tempered that he should not feel the effects of age.

“The Bahman Yesht Pehlvi,
rather the epitome than the translation of the true Báhmán Zand, may
be called the Apocalypse of the Parsees. It presents, in the form of a
prophecy, an abridged history of the empire and of the religion of the
Persians, from Gushtasp to the end of the world.” That part of the
Dabistán which follows, said to be transcribed from the Zand Avesta by
a Mobed, may be presumed to be taken from the true Báhmán Yesht Zand;
still these prophecies are undoubtedly compositions of later times interpolated
in the original works.&mdash;<abbr title="Anthony Troyer">A. T.</abbr></p>

 It is mentioned in the Situd gher (the 2nd Nosk of the Zend-Avesta)
that Zoroaster, having demanded immortality, Ormuzd showed him a tree
of four branches: the first of gold, this indicated the reign of Gushtasp;
the second of silver, that of Ardeshir Babegan; the third of brass, that of
Nushirvan, and the troubles excited by Mazdak; the fourth of iron mixed
with other metals, the destruction of the Persian empire. According to
the Báhmán Jesht Zand, Ormuzd refusing a second demand of immortality
made by Zoroaster, pours into his hands a few drops of water, after
the drinking of which he is during seven days and nights filled with
divine intelligence, and sees all that passes upon the seven <dfn>kechvars</dfn>, or
“districts of the earth.” He sees a second tree, having seven branches of
metal, which indicate seven epochas and the events belonging to them;
the first branch, which is of gold, designates the reign of Gushtasp.
Zoroaster then no more desires immortality. Ormuzd announces to him,
moreover, the war which Arjasp will make upon Gushtasp.&mdash;(<abbr title="Zend-Avesta, tome One, 2 Preface"><cite>Zend-Av.</cite>,

copious details the woes which are to afflict the world, during the
influence of the iron branch:, he speaks of the march of armies, of physical
convulsions, of the diminished productions of nature, of the conquests
made by Arabs, Greeks, Turks, Chinese, and Christians. All this
misery is to end on the arrival of king Báhrám Varjavand, who is to
re-establish the ancient Persian empire: by the successive mission of the
three sons of Zoroaster, who are to convert the world and confirm their
divine mission by working miracles. Sosiosh is to restore purity to the

<p class="footnote">According to several Parsee doctors, seven of these Nosks, or rather

l’Acad. des Inscript. et des B.-L.</cite>, <abbr title="tome 38 page">t. xxxviii. p.</abbr> 239-254.) I have abridged
the explanation of each Nosk; the contents of several of them are much
alike, and the miscellaneous matters in them all confusedly stated.</p>

<p class="fnhanging unindent"><abbr title="One">I.</abbr>&mdash;The first Nosk,
called <span class="title">Setud-yesht</span>, “Nosk of prayer or praise,” has
33 chapters.</p>

<p class="fnhanging unindent"><abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>&mdash;The second,
named <span class="title">Setud-gher</span>, “Nosk of prayer and praise,” has
22 chapters, and treats of the purity of actions, of collections for
the poor, of the concord which is to subsist between relations.</p>

<p class="fnhanging unindent"><abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>&mdash;<span class="title">Vehest
Mantsre</span>, “heavenly word,” has 22 chapters. It discourses
on faith, on the strict observation of the law, and on the propensities
of the heart. Mention is made of the qualities of Zardusht, and
of the pure people and pure actions which have existed before him.</p>

<p class="fnhanging unindent"><abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr>&mdash;<span class="title">Bagh</span>,
“happiness, light, or garden,” in 21 chapters, states the
substance and the true meaning of the law, God’s commands with
respect to obedience, fidelity, justice, purity of actions, the means
of guarding against Satan, and of going into the other world.</p>

<p class="fnhanging unindent"><abbr title="Five">V.</abbr>&mdash;<span class="title">Dóazdah
Hamast</span>, the twelve Hamasts, that is, “means or things
produced at the same time.” This book, in 32 chapters, speaks
of the bad people of the upper and nether world, of the nature of all
beings, of the whole creation of God, of the resurrection, of the
bridge Chinavad, and of the fate after death.</p>

<p class="fnhanging unindent"><abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr>&mdash;<span class="title">Nader</span>,
“the excellent, the rare.” This book of 35 chapters is
assigned to astronomy, to the influences of the stars upon the actions
of men; it corresponds with the Arabic work <span class="title">Buftal</span> (<span class="title">Bufastál</span>); its
Persian name is <span class="title">Favameshian</span> (<span class="title">Favaímasíhan</span>); that is, by means
of this science future events are known.</p>

<p class="fnhanging unindent"><abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr>&mdash;<span class="title">Pajem</span>
means perhaps “small animal, or retribution.” This book,
in 22 chapters, gives an account of quadrupeds; of actions permitted
or not; what animals may be killed or eat, what not; what may
be killed for the use of the <dfn>Gahanbars</dfn>, that is, the six festivals in
the year instituted in commemoration of the first creation of the
world in 365 days; and about regulations relative to these festivals,
to meritorious acts and gifts.</p>

<p class="fnhanging unindent"><abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr>&mdash;<span class="title">Reteshtai</span>,
“the Nosk of warriors or of chiefs.” The subjects of
this book form 50 chapters, 13 of which only have survived the
time of Alexander; they are: the orders of the king, the obedience
of the subjects, the conduct of the judges, the foundation of towns,
and the various things and animals created by God.</p>

<p class="fnhanging unindent"><abbr title="Nine">IX.</abbr>&mdash;<span class="title">Beresht</span>,
“execution of orders, or supremacy.” This book, of 60
chapters, 12 of which only remain after Alexander, treats of kings
and judges; of the reciprocal relations of the governors and the
governed; of the occupations prescribed to the different classes and
professions of men; of useful knowledge; of the vices of men; and
such like things.</p>

<p class="fnhanging unindent"><abbr title="Ten">X.</abbr>&mdash;<span class="title">Kesesrob</span>,
perhaps “agreeable word.” This book, at first of 60 chapters,
of 15 only after Alexander’s conquest, discourses upon the soul,
science, intellect, natural and acquired; upon morality, and the
consequences of its being observed or violated.</p>

<p class="fnhanging unindent"><abbr title="Eleven">XI.</abbr>&mdash;<span class="title">Veshtasp</span>,
<span class="title">Veshap</span>, once of 60, but after Alexander of 10 chapters
only, contains an eulogy upon the government of Veshtasp (Gushtasp),
upon his having adopted, observed, and propagated Zardusht’s
laws.</p>

<p class="fnhanging unindent"><abbr title="Twelve">XII.</abbr>&mdash;<span class="title">Khesht</span>,
“brick, or little lance, or agriculture.” This book, in
22 chapters, discusses six subjects relative to religion, policy, morals,
cultivation, political economy, and administration of justice. In
the fifth part are stated the four venerable classes of men, which
are the kings and chiefs, the warriors, the cultivators, and the
tradesmen.</p>

<p class="fnhanging unindent"><abbr title="Thirteen">XIII.</abbr>&mdash;<span class="title">Sefand</span>,
“excellent,” inculcates in 60 chapters the observation of
moral and religious duties, and the faith in the miracles of Zardusht.</p>

<p class="fnhanging unindent"><abbr title="Fourteen">XIV.</abbr>&mdash;<span class="title">Jeresht</span>,
“he does;” this book, of 22 chapters, treats of the birth
and the destination of man.</p>

<p class="fnhanging unindent"><abbr title="Fifteen">XV.</abbr>&mdash;<span class="title">Baghantast</span>,
“the Yesht of the fortunate,” contains in 17 chapters
the praise of God, of the angels, and of the man who approaches
God and is thankful for the benefits which he receives from above.</p>

<p class="fnhanging unindent"><abbr title="Sixteen">XVI.</abbr>&mdash;<span class="title">Niaram</span>
means, perhaps, “I do not seek my advantage.” This
book, of 54 chapters, teaches the good employ of one’s fortune, and
the advantages of a good behaviour towards God and men.</p>

<p class="fnhanging unindent"><abbr title="Seventeen">XVII.</abbr>&mdash;<span class="title">Asparam</span>,
may signify “the ties, the book by excellence, the
dawn, the heaven, perfect, plant, leaf.” It treats in 64 chapters
of the <span class="title">Nerengs</span>, that is of the powers, faculties in different acceptations;
here of the powers of good actions, and of liturgical ceremonies.</p>

<p class="fnhanging unindent"><abbr title="Eighteen">XVIII.</abbr>&mdash;<span class="title">Davaserujed</span>,

 According to another tradition Gushtasp himself had travelled in
India, and had been instructed by the Brahmans. In the Desátir (English
transl., Comment, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 185, 186), we read that, when Sekander conquered
Iran, Sásán, the son of Darab, went to India, where he practised the
worship of Yezdan in a cavern, and where he died. He left a son named
Jivánasp, who is known as the second Sásán, equal to his father, and who
took his abode in Kabulistan. Ardeshir (the son of another Sásán, of the
Kayanián race, a relative of the Saint), admonished by a dream, went to
Kabulistan, and by his entreaties prevailed upon the second Sásán to follow
him to Istakhar, where Ardeshir erected, for the habitation of the
saint, an immense monastery adorned with figures of the stars, and having
fire-temples on its different sides. These and other traditions afford the
inference that, in early times, a religious intercourse had taken place
between India and Persia.&mdash;<abbr title="Anthony Troyer">A. T.</abbr></p>

 In the Desátir (English <abbr title="translation, page">translat., p.</abbr> 120) the Greek philosopher is
called <span class="title">Tútíanush</span>. We are at a loss even to guess at the Greek to
whom these names may be applied. We may however remember that
St. Clement of Alexandria places Pythagoras about the 62nd Olympiad,
or about 528 years B. C., and says that he was a zealous follower of Zoroaster,
and had consulted the Magi. Jamblicus, in his life of Pythagoras
(cap. 4) states, that this philosopher was taken prisoner by Cambyses and
carried to Babylon, where, in his intercourse with the Magi, he was
instructed in their modes of worship, perhaps by Zoroaster himself, if
<span class="person">Zabratus</span> and <span class="person">Nazaratus</span>,
mentioned as his instructors by Diogenes and
Alexander, can be identified with the Persian prophet. Now, the long
reign of Lohrasp (of 120 years) is supposed by some chronologers to comprehend
the reigns of Cambyses and of Smerdis. Upon this uncertain
chronological ground, Pythagoras may be placed in the times of Gushtasp,
to whom, as was before said, Foucher with others assigns an epocha
more remote than that of Darius Hystaspes of the Greeks. It is known
that Alexander, by the conquest of Persia, accomplished, to a certain
degree and for a certain time, his glorious project to connect the East
with the West; an open intercourse took place between the Asiatics and
the Greeks, whose language was widely spread in Asia. The Macedonian
conqueror is there generally believed to have been the son of Darab
(Darius), and the brother of Báhmán Isfendiar. He received, says the
Desátir (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 123), from the hands of his Persian
spouse Pari-dokht Roshenak
(Parysatis Roxana), “the bright daughter of the fairy,” a book
of Zardusht addressed to him, and forming a part of the Desátir. Alexander
ordered the Persian books to be translated into Greek, called
the <span class="title">Nurakhi</span> language, in the Desatir, in which is also said
(<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 124):
“Hence the sect of Internal Illumination will arise among the <span class="title">Nurakhis</span>,
as well as that of Reason.” To this passage the Commentary
subjoins: “The sect of Gúshtaspians of Iran and Yunán is
a medium between the Illuminated and the Rationalist. When
Sekander came to Iran, he found that the Gúshtaspians of Iran
were the better and wiser; and he found that they had such power
that, when they pleased, they left the body, which they treated as
a garment. And besides them he saw another class of men in Irán,
who, by means of reason and meditation (<dfn>nurnu´d</dfn>) discovered the
real nature of things as they actually exist; and there was no such
class of men in Yunán. Having collected all their books, he translated
them into the Yunáni and Rúmi tongues. He then gave his prime
minister (Dostur) and teacher the title of the chief Mobéd and Sage,
and made him the head of the Nirnúdis. From this time forward the
sect of Rationalists prevailed among the Yunanis and Rúmis.” Alexander’s
prime minister is supposed by the Asiatics to have been Aristotle;
we know that this philosopher had an accurate knowledge of Zoroaster’s
doctrine. Although the history, religion, and science of the Asiatics have
certainly not been neglected by the inquisitive Greeks, Alexander’s companions,
among whom was Callisthenes, a relation of Aristotle, yet we
find in the western histories no particular notice corroborating the
account just quoted of the Desátir. Unfortunately we may be more
positive about the destruction of ancient monumental works in Persia by
the son of Philip; it is for having burnt the Nosks that he is said by
the Persians to be burning in hell (see Anquetil,
<abbr title="volume two page">vol. II. p.</abbr> 338).&mdash;<abbr title="Anthony Troyer">A. T.</abbr></p>

and the Indian sages is related.</p>

<p class="footnote">Here ends the principal part of the historical account which the Dabistán
gives of Zoroaster’s life. I shall add, according to Anquetil (<cite><abbr title="Zend-Avesta">Zend-Av.</abbr></cite>,
<abbr title="tome One, Second Part, pages">t. I. 2. P. pp.</abbr> 60-62),
a summary account of its principal events in chronological
order.</p>

<p class="footnote">Anquetil supposes Zoroaster born 589 years B. C. At the age of 30
years he goes to Irán, through which country he only passes. He disappears
then to the eyes of the Persians during ten years. His followers
say that he was transported before the throne of God. It was in this
interval of time that he terminated several works which he had perhaps
already begun upon mount Alborz, or in Chaldæa. The mountains afforded
him retirement. The twenty years which he is said to have passed
in the deserts were, probably, from his twentieth to his fortieth year.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="cypress" id="cypress"></a>At this age he appeared
before Gushtasp, in Balkh, and at this very
time Hystaspes, father of Darius, may have reigned in Bactria. Zoroaster
performed miracles during ten years: this is the period of his mission.
After his first miracles, his reputation having spread afar, Changragháchah
came to meet him. This Brahman treats him in his letter to Gushtasp as
a young man, and well might an old man, such as Changragháchah was,
have so called a man of forty years. It is also to this time that Anquetil
refers what is said about the cypress-tree which Zoroaster planted before
the <span class="title">Atesh-gadah</span>, or the fire-temple, of Kichmar in Khorassan. Isfendiár
was then very young, because about twenty-eight years later his elder
son was not yet married; and Darius, 540 years B. C., might have been
ten years old.</p>

<p class="footnote">At the age of sixty-five years, Zoroaster delivered in Babylon lessons of
philosophy, and counted Pythagoras among his disciples; Cambyses,
according to the Greeks, filled then the throne of Persia. Three years
afterwards, the legislator returned from Chaldæa for establishing the
worship of the cypress, which lasted eight years. Persia had then acknowledged
Darius, the son of Hystaspes, as king.</p>

<p class="footnote">After these eight years, Zoroaster advised the war against Turan. He
was very old. The Shahnamah calls him <dfn>pír</dfn>, “old.” Gushtasp, victorious
over the Turaniáns, heaps every honor upon him, and he dies, some
time after, at the age of seventy-seven years, in the interval of time
which elapsed between the expedition of Gushtasp and the invasion of
the Turaniáns. Báhmán, the eldest son of Isfendiar, was able to carry
arms, and Darius, 512 B. C., might have been thirty-eight years old.</p>

<p class="footnote">As to the posterity of Zoroaster&mdash;he had been successively married to
three wives. With the first he had one son and three daughters; with the
second two sons; it is not certain whether he had any offspring with his
third wife, called Húó, the niece of Jamasp&mdash;the Zand-books however
say, that she brought him three sons, who are to appear about the end of
the world.&mdash;<abbr title="Anthony Troyer">A. T.</abbr></p>

<p class="footnote">According to Zand and Parsee writings, the birth and actions of these
sons will be equally miraculous. Zoroaster, having visited Húó three
times on her going to bathe, the germs remained in the water. The Izeds
(or genii) Nerioseng and Anahid were charged with their custody, until
the period when three virgins bathing in the same water, should receive
these germs in succession, and bring into the world the three sons
of Zoroaster.</p>

<p class="footnote">The first is named <span class="person">Oshederbámi</span>. He is to appear at the commencement
of the last millennium of the world, and to arrest the sun’s course during
ten days and nights; and as Zoroaster converted one of the four portions
of the human race, he is to convert the second to the law, and give them
the 22nd Nosk.</p>

<p class="footnote">The second posthumous son is <span class="person">Oshedermáh</span>. He is to appear four
hundred years after Oshederbámi, and to arrest the sun’s course during
ten days and nights; he is also to bring the 23rd Nosk of the law, and to
convert the third portion of the human race.</p>

<p class="footnote">The third is named <span class="person">Sosiosh</span>. He shall appear at the end of ages,
arrest the sun’s course during thirty days and nights, bring the 24th
Nosk of the law, and the whole world is to embrace the faith of Zoroaster:
after this comes on the resurrection.&mdash;(<abbr title="Zend-Avesta, tome One,

 Ardai Viráf or Arda Viráf or Virasp, also simply called Viraf or
Virasp, was, about the year 200 of our era, one of the most zealous followers
and defenders of Zoroaster’s religion, which, under Alexander the
Great and the other kings of Persia, had lost its first authority (see Hyde,
<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 278, 279). Arda Viraf is mentioned in one of the
<span class="title">Yeshts Sades</span>, or
prayers called <span class="title">Dup Néreng</span>, which are recited when perfumes are thrown
into the fire (<abbr title="Zend-Avesta, tome Two, page"><cite>Zend-Av.</cite>,

 In the <cite>Shah nameh Naser</cite> it is stated, in the life of Ardashir Babegan
(see Hyde, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 280) that this king, abolishing several regulations of Alexander
the Great, granted toleration to followers of the faith professed by Gushtasp,
and wishing to re-establish Zoroaster’s religion, demanded from its
Mobeds miracles, which they performed. The king, satisfied by these
proofs, not only adopted their tenets himself, but obliged all others to
do the same. In the life of Shapur it is said, in the book quoted, that,
when Ardashir was inaugurated in the government, he demanded from
the chiefs of the Magi miracles, after the performance of which Ardai
Viráf, during a whole week, supporting by arguments the truth of his
religion, brought also forward all that relates to hell and heaven. Some
believed; others doubted or denied: the number of the last was 80,000.&mdash;<abbr title="Anthony Troyer">A. T.</abbr></p>

 The Revelations of Ardái Viraf are said to have been originally written
in Zand. There exists a Viraf nameh in Pehlvi, probably of the fourth
century of our era; works of this name are found in modern Persian in
prose and in verse. Anquetil mentions a Viraf nameh in verse, composed
A. D. 1532, by Káús, Herbed of Náusari, and another by Zardusht, son
of Báhrám (<abbr title="Zend-Avesta, tome One, Second Part, note pages
9, 10, 30, 32"><cite>Zend-Av.</cite>, t. I. 2. P. not. pp. ix. x. xxx. xxxii</abbr>). Translations
of this work have also been made into Sanskrit and the Hindu language
of Guzerat. An English translation of the Ardai-Viraf Nameh, by T. A.
Pope, appeared in 1816. The translator says in his preface (p. xiii):
that the Revelations of Ardai Viraf appear to be the same work that is
mentioned by Richardson as the work of Ardeshir Babegan, which having
been improved by Nushirvan the Just, in the sixth century, was sent by
him to all the governors of provinces, as the invariable rule of their
conduct. Pope examined for his work three versions in the modern Persian:
the first in prose, by Nushirvan Kermani; the second in verse, by
Zardusht Biram (Báhrám); the third in prose, by the same (<cite>ibid.</cite>, <abbr title="page 14">p. xiv</abbr>).&mdash;<abbr title="Anthony Troyer">A. T.</abbr></p>

 <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">رسن</span>, <dfn>rasan</dfn> is a linear

not be ascertained. According to common belief of the Muhammedans,
this bridge appears of different shapes; to the good, a straight and pleasant
road of thirty-seven fathoms in breadth; but to the wicked it is
like the edge of a sword, on which they totter and fall into the abyss
below. According to the translation of Pope (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 11), when Ardai Viráf
found himself close to the bridge, it appeared to him to be a broad and
good road.&mdash;<abbr title="Anthony Troyer">A. T.</abbr></p>

 Mihr Ized is the same as Mithra. He is the most active champion
against Ahriman and the host of evil genii; he has one thousand ears
and ten thousand eyes; a club, a bow, arrows, and a golden poniard in
his hand; he traverses the space between heaven and earth; he gives
light, that is the sun, to the earth; he directs the course of water, and
blesses mankind with progeny and the fruits of the field: the earth
receives from him its warriors and virtuous kings; he watches over the
law, and maintains the harmony of the world. After death, he not only
grants protection against the attacks of the impure spirits, but assigns
heaven to the souls of the just. It is there that he appears in the celestial
assembly of holy Fervers surrounding the throne of Ormuzd
(see <abbr title="Zend-Avesta, tome Two, pages"><cite>Zend-Av.</cite>,
t. II. pp.</abbr> 204. 205. 222. 223. 256. and in other places).</p>

<p class="footnote">Mithra is by some authors identified with Ormuzd himself, and with
the sun; but it results from Anquetil’s investigations that, in the religion
of the Persians, he is distinct from both and subordinate to Ormuzd.</p>

<p class="footnote">He occupies a much higher rank in the religious system of the Chaldæans
and the Arabs, who first venerated Mithra. It is now established
beyond any doubt, by a good number of authentic monuments, that in
later times the religion and worship of Mithra has been greatly developed
in dogmas, symbols, and a system of mysteries relating to cosmology,
astronomy, and physiology: in the first centuries of the Christian era,
this religion appears to have been spread, not only over Asia, but also
over a great part of Europe. This subject has been very learnedly treated
at great length in modern works of too great celebrity to require mentioning
here.&mdash;<abbr title="Anthony Troyer">A. T.</abbr></p>

 In Pope’s translation of the Viráf-nameh we find (<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 13-15) what
follows: “When Serósh Ized laid hold of my arm, we proceeded to the
top of the bridge, one side of which appeared in full splendor of light
and the other in total darkness, when I heard a strong and extraordinary
noise which, on looking forwards, I perceived to come from a
dog, that was chained with a collar and chain of gold, near the light
side of the bridge.&mdash;I asked the angels: ‘Why is the dog here?’&mdash;to
which Serósh Izad replied: ‘He makes this noise to frighten Ahriman,
and keeps watch here to prevent his approach; his name is <span class="person">Zering
Goash</span> (Cerberus?) and the devils shake at his voice; and any soul that
has, during its residence in the lower world, hurt or ill used or destroyed
any of these animals, is prevented by Zering Goash from proceeding
any further across the bridge; and, Ardai Viraf, when you
return again to the world, as one of the first duties, enjoin the taking
care of these animals.” According to the <cite>Vendidad Sadé</cite>
(<abbr title="Zend-Avesta, tome One, Second Part, page"><cite>Zend-Av.</cite>, t.
I. 2. P. p.</abbr> 418), the souls, strong and holy, who have done good works, shall,
at their passage over the bridge Chanivad, be protected by the dog of the
herds. On that account the Persian kings had (see <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Brissonii de Reg.
Pers. princip. libri tres</cite>, <abbr title="liber One page">l. I. p.</abbr> 157)
at their table a particular meal
prepared for the dog. The Parsees in our days have great regard for
dogs. Immense numbers of these animals are fed by those people,
though not admitted into their houses.&mdash;<abbr title="Anthony Troyer">A. T.</abbr></p>

 The Viraf-nameh, a sort of Persian “Divina Commedia,” contains,
in Pope’s translation, a description much more detailed than here,

has preserved to us, from a treatise of Celsus against the Christians.
This philosopher, speaking of certain mysteries among the Persians, mentions
seven doors, which are of lead, tin, brass, iron, mixed metal, silver,
and gold, corresponding in their order to the heavenly bodies, Saturn,
Venus, Jupiter, Mercury, Mars, the moon, and the sun; above the last is
an eighth door, most likely the heavenly Alborz, “the region of the primordial

We learn from the Boun-Dehesh, the
Zardúsht-nameh, and other works, that the ascension of the souls was
effected through the five planets which, in the mysterious ladder of
Celsus, are placed before the moon and the sun, who himself rests upon
mount Alborz. M. F. Lajard makes use with great sagacity of the passage
of Celsus, in support of his explanation of the mithriacal monuments
which are the subjects of his learned Memoir.&mdash;<abbr title="Anthony Troyer">A. T.</abbr></p>

 <dfn>Kashti</dfn> is a girdle commonly of wool or of camel’s hair, consisting of
seventy-two threads, to go at least twice round the body, say, about ten
feet in length. The breadth depends upon the thickness of the threads.
It is tied about the <dfn>saderé</dfn>, which is a sort of white shirt, worn immediately
upon the skin, with short sleeves, open above and commonly not
passing the hips. This girdle was worn by the Parsees from time immemorial.
They pretend that Jemshid, being instructed by Hom, the primitive
legislator, invented the Kashti. Before the time of Zoroaster, it was
worn indifferently as a scarf, or wrapped round the head. The monuments
of Persepolis exhibit persons wearing the Kashti. Not to wear it
in the fifteenth year is a great sin; the day on which it is taken for the
first time is a festival, and daily prayers are prescribed before putting it
on, and frequent ceremonies are connected with it (<abbr title="Zend-Avesta, tome Two, pages"><cite>Zend-Av.</cite>, t. II. pp.</abbr>
529). Nothing can be right or good that is done without the Kashti:
“ungirt, unblessed” (Hyde, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 376). We have here a striking example
how a custom originally suggested by simple convenience, to be girt, or
to be ready, <dfn lang="la" xml:lang="la">accingere se</dfn>, acquires by religious prescription an importance
far beyond its intended use and purpose.&mdash;<abbr title="Anthony Troyer">A. T.</abbr></p>

 The account of Ardai Viraf’s vision of the other world can but remind
us of what Plato relates (<abbr title="Res Publica, tome 10">Respubl., t. x</abbr>) of Hero, the son of Armenius,
a Pamphilian by origin: viz., when this man had been killed in
battle, and when, on the tenth day, the dead bodies were in a state of decomposition,
he alone was preserved and carried home to be buried, and
on the twelfth day, being placed upon the funeral pyre, he gave signs of
life, and, resuscitated, he related what he had seen in the other world.
Upon this we may reflect, that the name of <span class="title">Arda</span>, which occurs as a part of
many Persian names, may be referred to the Sanskrit <span lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">ऊर्ध</span> <dfn>ûrdha</dfn>, “elevated;”
Ardashir is perhaps <span lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">ऊर्ध शिरः</span> <dfn>úrdhaśiras</dfn>, “elevated head;”
<span lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">ऊर्द्दर</span> <dfn>úrddara</dfn>, signifies “a hero, a champion;
from <span lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">ऊर्ज</span> <dfn>úrja</dfn>, to be
strong: which would give nearly the sense of Plato’s <span lang="el" xml:lang="el">αλκιμου του ανδρος</span>,
“of the strong man,” as he characterises Hero. This observation gains
perhaps some relief, by connecting it with a passage of St. Clement of
Alexandria (<abbr title="Stromata, One, Five Section 14">Strom. I. V. sect. xiv.</abbr>), in which he interprets by Zoroaster
the name of Hero, and quotes a passage from a work in which this supposed
Zoroaster relates of himself what Plato states of Hero. The work
mentioned by St. Clement, much known in the first centuries of our era,
might have been composed by a Neo-platonic who transposed the fable
from Hero to Zoroaster. Hero, certainly not Zoroaster, may with more
probability be assimilated to one of his zealous followers, Ardai Viraf,
who lived in the second century of our era.&mdash;<abbr title="Anthony Troyer">A. T.</abbr></p>

 According to the concurrent testimony of Persian records, <span class="person">Azarbad</span>,
the son of <span class="person">Maresfand</span>, was the thirtieth descendant from Zoroaster.
Twenty-nine generations, at four to a century, make 725 years; to this
add forty for the probable age of Azarbad at the time of his assuming
the prophetic mission: if from the sum 765 we subtract 240, that is, the
epocha of king Shapúr, under whom Azarbad lived, there will remain
525, the time of Zoroaster before Christ. Four generations are here
assigned to a century, because, according to Zoroaster’s law, marriage
is an act of religion, and children are the steps or ladders for ascending
to heaven: the observance of this precept must have tended to
multiply the generations in the legislator’s family (Rauzet-us Safa, Shea’s

Shapúr heard of the great uncertainty still prevailing among a considerable
number of men about the truth of Zoroaster’s religion, he demanded
a solution of the great question from the principal priests, among whom
Azarbad rose and offered to satisfy him: “I will,” said he, “further
develop Ardai Viraf’s account of hell and heaven, and sit naked
from head to foot, whilst eighteen pounds of melted brass are poured
upon my body; if the least particle of it be hurt, the prophet’s words
are false; they are true, if I receive not the least injury.” No harm
ensued to him from the trial made upon his person, and all believed.&mdash;<abbr title="Anthony Troyer">A. T.</abbr></p>

 The Viraf nameh terminates by these words: “The Masdian religion
became more firmly established than ever, and continued in all its purity
until the Mahomedan conquest dispersed its votaries, and forced those
who persevered in it to abandon the tombs of their ancestors, and to
fly for refuge to distant countries. A small number fled to, and were
kindly received on, the shores of western India, and the present Parsees
of Bombay and Surat are their descendants.” That is to say, it was a
short time after Yezdejerd’s death that, persecuted by the Muhammedans,
a number of Persians, to preserve their ancient religion, fled to Kohistan,
from whence after a century they descended to Ormuz on the Persian gulf,
and after a stay there of fifteen years landed at Diu on the Indian coast.
Nineteen years later they established themselves in the Guzerat; thence,
after the lapse of three hundred years, they dispersed to the north and south
of Surat. They had been five centuries in India when they fought with
the Indians against the Muhammedans, and were again obliged to fly
before the enemies of their faith. They maintained themselves, however,
in different places of the province of Aurungabad. Having gradually
increased in numbers to about 150,000 families (in 1816), they live dispersed
in villages from Diu to Bombay, in which place about 24,000 of
them reside (<abbr title="Zend-Avesta, tome One, Part 1, Page 318"><cite>Zend

 The Sad-der naser (in prose) is an abridgment of practical and ceremonial
theology, called Sad-der, or “one hundred doors,” because the
hundred chapters of which it is composed are like so many doors leading
to heaven. Some Parsees think that the original was written in Pehlvi.

establishest as king whoever consoles and nourishes the poor.” The

The author of the Dabistán has so abridged this Der that it is deemed

from the principles of religion, that we must concede due authority
to the Dustúr and must not deviate from his commands, as he is
the ornament and splendor of the faith. Although thy good works
may be countless as the leaves of the trees, the grains of sand, the
drops of rain, or the stars in the heavens, thou canst gain nothing by
them, unless they be acceptable in the sight of the Dustúr: if he be
not content with thee, thou shalt have no praise in this world: therefore,
my son, thou shalt pay to the Dustúr who teaches thee the tithe
of all thou possessest (wealth and property of every kind, gold and
silver). Therefore thou, who desirest to enjoy paradise to all eternity,
pay tithes to the Dustúr; for if he be satisfied with thee, know that
paradise is thine; but if he be not content with thee, thou canst derive
no portion of benefit from thy good works; thy soul shalt not find its
way to paradise; thou shalt have no place along with angels; thy soul
can never be delivered from the fiends of hell, which is to be thy
eternal abode: but pay the tithes, and the Dustúrs will be pleased with
thee, and thy soul shall get to paradise without delay. Truly the Dustúrs
know the religion of all men, understand all things, and deliver
all (faithful) men.”&mdash;<abbr title="David Shea">D. S.</abbr></p>

 The terms Miezd and Darun require some farther illustration: the
following is from the Zend-Avesta, <abbr title="volume two page">vol. II. p.</abbr> 534. The Miezd, that is,
meats previously blessed and then eaten, either during or after the service;
flowers, fruits, especially pomegranates and dates; rice, fragrant
seeds, and perfumes; milk; the small cakes called Darun; the branches
of the Hom and its juice, called Perahom; the roots of trees, particularly
the pomegranate tree. The roots are cut, the milk, and in general all these
offerings, are prepared with ceremonies described at great length in the
<cite>Ravaets</cite>, or “ritual treatises.” These offerings, and the sacred implements,
which are twenty-six in number, constitute the thirty-three objects
as specified by Zoroaster in the latter part of the first Ha of the Izechné,
<abbr title="volume one Part Two page">vol. I. P. II. p.</abbr> 87:
“I invoke and laud all the mighty, the pure Dustúrs
who have thirty-three objects around and near the Havan (the vase for
holding the Perahom): they are pure, according to the ordinance of
Zaradusht, who was instructed by the Supreme Lord himself.” The
Daruns are small cakes of unleavened bread, nearly the form and thickness
of a crown piece: there are two or four of these offered, according to
the nature of the service. The Darun on which they place a little dressed
meat is called <dfn>Darun Fusesté</dfn>, or “offered bread.”&mdash;<abbr title="David Shea">D. S.</abbr></p>

 The Afirgans, or Afernigáns, are the prayers and benedictions recited
during the Gahanbar or the last ten days of the year, and on the anniversary
of deceased parents or relations: but the service on the third
night after the decease is not to be neglected, as in that case the soul of
the deceased would remain without protection until the resurrection.
On the third night, at the Oshen Gah, or midnight, there are four services;
one for each of the angels, Rashin Rast, Ram Izad, and Surush,
the fourth in honor of the Ferouers of holy personages. In this last service
are recited nine Kardés, or portions of the <span class="title">Vispared</span>, and four dresses,
fruits, and cheese are laid by for the officiating priest, along with the
Darun.</p>

<p class="footnote">The word <dfn>Vispered</dfn> admits of two meanings: 1. “the knowledge of
“every thing,” <dfn>Vispé Khirad</dfn>;” 2. “all the chiefs,” <dfn>Vispé Rad</dfn>. The
latter meaning seems more analogous to the Vispered, as it begins by
invoking the chiefs of all beings&mdash;such as the first of the heavens, the
first of the earth, the first of aquatic creatures, etc. Zoroaster is supposed
to have repeated to the Brahmin Chingégratch this Vispered, which
begins thus: “I invoke and laud the first of the heavens, the first of the
earth, the first of aquatic beings, the first of terrestrial beings, the first
of brilliant and intelligent beings, the holy, pure, and great Chingégrâtchás;”
and it ends with “I invoke and laud the bull exalted on
high, who makes the herbage to grow in abundance; this bull, the
pure gift, who has given (being) to the pure man.” The Vispered is
divided into twenty-seven <dfn>Kardés</dfn>, or “sections,” and probably formed
part of the Baghantást of the fifteenth Nosk of the Avesta. It is recited
by day, as well as the Izeshneh (Yazishnah), and with a Barsom, or “bundle,
of thirty-five branches of trees.</p>

<p class="footnote">Izeshné (Yazishnah) means a prayer setting forth the greatness of the
personage thus addressed. It is composed of seventy-two Há, which the
Parsees divide into two parts: the first part contains twenty-seven Há,
addressed to Ormuzd and his creation; the second contains prayers addressed
to the Supreme Being; it speaks of man, of his wants, of the several
genii charged to protect him, etc. The word Há, which signifies a
portion of the Izeshné, is derived from the Zend Hâetîm, or Hâtarim,
portions. From Hâtaum is also formed “Had,” which signifies “measure,
limit.” The Izeshné probably formed part of the Setud-yesht, the
first Nosk of the Avesta, or of the Setud-gher, the second Nosk. The
Izeshné is performed at the <dfn>Gah Havan</dfn>, or “sunrise;” when, recited by
itself without other prayers, the Izeshnéh Sadah is read with the same
ceremonies as the Vendidad Sâdeh, excepting that the <dfn>Barsom</dfn>, or
“sacred bundle of twigs” [see hereafter, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> <a href="#Page_319">319</a>],
consists then of only
twenty-three branches. The Vendidad and Vispered cannot be recited
without the Izeshné, and the Barsom for these two offices consists of
thirty-five branches.</p>

<p class="footnote">The term <dfn>Sâde</dfn> means “pure,” or the text without a translation.</p>

<p class="footnote">The two works, the Izeshné and Vispered, joined to the Vendidad, the
twentieth Nosk of the Avesta, form the Vendidad Sadé, which the Mobeds
are obliged to recite every day, commencing at the <dfn>Gâh Oshen</dfn>, or “midnight,”
or before day-break, so that it may be finished before sunrise.</p>

<p class="footnote">In this translation, the reading of the manuscript has been followed as
being the most simple: there seems however something omitted. Annexed
is the form of prayer recited in Váj, which means mental recitation: it is
taken from Anquetil du Perron:</p>

<p class="footnote center">THE PRAYERS RECITED BY PARSEES BEFORE MEAT.</p>

<p class="footnote"><span class="title">Etha aad avirmede.</span>&mdash;“Ormuzd
is king: now I make Izeshné to Ormuzd
the giver of pure flocks, the giver of pure waters, of pure trees,
the giver of light, of earth, and of every kind of good.” This is to be
recited once.</p>

<p class="footnote"><span class="title">Eshem Trihu.</span>&mdash;“Abundance
and paradise are reserved for the just and
undefiled person; he who does heavenly and pure works.” To be
recited three times.</p>

<p class="footnote center">PRAYERS AFTER MEAT.</p>

<p class="footnote"><span class="title">Ethu ahu Virio.</span>&mdash;“It is
the desire of Ormuzd that the chief (of the
law) should perform pure and holy works. Bahman gives (abundance)
to him who acts with holiness in the world. O Ormuzd! thou establishest
as king whoever comforts and nourishes the poor.” To be
repeated twice.</p>

<p class="footnote"><span class="title">Eshem vuhu.</span>&mdash;“Abundance
and paradise, etc.” To be repeated once.</p>

<p class="footnote"><span class="title">Ehmarestchi.</span>&mdash;“Mayest
thou remain always effulgent with light!
may thy body be always in good condition! may thy body ever increase!
may thy body be ever victorious! may thy desires, when accomplished,
ever render thee happy! mayest thou always have distinguished
children! mayest thou live for ever! for length of time! for length of
years! and mayest thou be received for ever into the celestial abodes
of the holy, all radiant with light and happiness! enjoy a thousand
healths, ten thousand healths.”</p>

 Anquetil du Perron says (<cite>Zend-Avesta</cite>, <abbr title="tome Two, page">t. II. p.</abbr> 601):
“Of all the
religions known, that of the Parsís is perhaps the only one in which
fasting be neither meritorious nor even permitted. The Parsí, on the
contrary, believes to honor Ormuzd by nourishing himself well: because
the body, fresh and vigorous, renders the soul stronger against
the bad genii; because the man, feeling less want, reads the word with
more attention, and feels more courage for performing good works;
consequently several celestial spirits are especially charged with watching
over the welfare of man: Rameshné, Kharom, Khordád, and Amerdád
give abundance and pleasures to him, and it is the last of the Izeds
mentioned who produces in the fruits the taste and flavor which lead
men to apply them to that use for which Ormuzd has created them.”&mdash;<abbr title="Anthony Troyer">A. T.</abbr></p>

 For <dfn>yarshanom</dfn>, which is in the manuscripts and in the edition of Calcutta,
read <span class="title">Barashnom</span>. This is the name of one of the four sorts of purifications
prescribed to the Parsees; that called the <span class="title">Barashnom of nine
nights</span>, is believed the most efficacious. It is performed in a garden or
in a retired place, where a piece of ground 90 feet in length and 16 feet
in breadth is chosen for it, and, after having been cleaned and surrounded
by a narrow ditch and a hedge, covered with sand. Therein, after the
celebration of ceremonies during one or three days, a Mobed traces a
number of furrows or trenches, called <dfn>Keishs</dfn>, and forms several heaps of
stones according to prescribed rules; he prepares a beverage of ox’s urine
and water mixed with other sacred liquids: this the person to be purified
drinks in sacred vases, then enters into the <span class="place">Keishs</span>, accompanied by
Mobeds and a dog; there he strips, and receives on his body wine poured
over him, and washes himself with that given him by the Mobed. During
prayers recited by the purificator and himself, he passes over several heaps
of stones, his right hand on his head and his left upon the dog, and is
then rubbed with dust; in his progress over other heaps of stones, he
washes himself several times with water. This done, the purified person
goes out of the trenches, and performs other ablutions with water before
he dresses and puts on the <dfn>Koshti</dfn>, or “girdle.” The individual who
takes the <span class="title">Barashnom</span> remains separated from other men during nine
days, and at the end of the third, sixth, and ninth night, he washes himself
with a prescribed quantity of wine and water, and is subject to other
ceremonies. This is a very short abstract of the ceremonies practised in
our days; in the <cite>Vendidad Sadé</cite>, other very minute particulars and
prayers are given for the performance of purification, the usages of which
have in the course of time undergone some changes. See a completely
detailed account of these rites of purification in Anquetil’s elaborate
work, <cite>Zend-Avesta</cite>, <abbr title="tome One, Secnd Part, pages">t. I. 2. P. pp.</abbr>

 According to Olugh Beigh (Hyde, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 190), the name of the five supplementary
days of the Persian year of 360 days are as follows: Ahnavád,
Ashnavád, Isfendamád or Máz, Vahshat or Vahást, and Hashúnesh or
Hashtuvish (see also <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 62. <a href="#footnote_296"><abbr title="note">n.</abbr></a>).&mdash;<abbr title="Anthony Troyer">A. T.</abbr></p>

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_490" id="footnote_490"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_490"><span class="muchsmaller">[490]</span></a>
 According to Anquetil (<cite>Zend-Avesta</cite>, <abbr title="Two, page">II. p.</abbr> 575) the name of the five
supplementary days is <span class="title">Farvardians</span>, that is, “the days of the Fervers of
the law:” on these days, as the Persians believe, the souls of the blessed
and those of the damned come to visit their relations, who receive them
with the greatest magnificence in their houses, purified and adorned for
the occasion.</p>

<p class="footnote">In the composition of the name Farvardigán, appears to have entered
the word Gáhs, which denotes also the Epagomenes, and five female Izeds,

 Every city and village must have the tree called <span class="title">Aderán</span>, or <span class="title">Aderán
Sháh</span>, or “the chief of fires.” <dfn>Ader</dfn> is the Pá-zend of Ateré, which signifies
fire; which word, in Parsee writings, means the several fires which
showed themselves to mankind under different forms, and also their
presiding genii; whilst Atesh signifies the common fire. When a kitchen
fire has been used three times, the Parsees are bound to take it to the
Aderán: the other fires must be taken thither on the expiration of seven
days, on the day of Ader and those of his co-operating genii. The fire
Aderán itself is taken once every year, or at least every three years, to the
fire <span class="title">Behram</span>, which is the result of one thousand and one fires, taken from
fifteen different kinds of fire. In strictness there should be an Ader
Behrám in every province, and according to some Dustúrs, in every city.
On the expiration of a certain period, they take the ashes of the Behrám,
Aderán, and other fires into the fields, and strew them over the cultivated
grounds. It requires a ceremonial of thirty days to prepare the Behrám
fire (<cite>Zend-Avesta</cite>, <abbr title="tome Two, page">t. II. p.</abbr> 531).&mdash;<abbr title="David Shea">D. S.</abbr></p>

 The Parsees use for their purifications seven things: plain water;
<span class="title">Padiav</span> water; water of power, or <dfn>ab-í-zúr</dfn> (according to Hyde, golden
water) <span class="title">Yeshtí</span> water; earth; <span class="title">Noreng gomez</span>,
or ox’s urine; and <span class="title">Noreng

earth free from all kind of impurity.&mdash;<abbr title="David Shea">D. S.</abbr></p>

<a href="#fnanchor_496"><span class="muchsmaller">[496]</span></a>
 <dfn>Padiav</dfn> means “what renders or is rendered (pure) like water.” To
impart this quality to water, the officiating priest puts it in a large vase,
out of which he fills a smaller vessel; he afterwards pours out some of the
water three times from the smaller into the larger vessel, accompanying
each act with certain forms of prayer, on which the water becomes
Padiav.&mdash;<abbr title="David Shea">D. S.</abbr></p>

“I praise and magnify thee;” in the latter form this is only repeated

 According to Anquetil du Perron, the following are some of the ceremonies
practised on such occasions. On the approaching departure of
the soul from the body, they perform the <span class="title">Sag-díd</span> (the dog-saw) by presenting
a dog before the dying person, and that the animal may be
induced to look at him, they throw some bits of bread or meat near the
person. Without doubt Bardesanes, in <cite><abbr title="Eusebius Præparatio evangelica, liber">Euseb.
præp. Evan. lib.</abbr></cite>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 277,
alludes to this custom where he says: “All the Medes expose the dying,
whilst yet breathing, to dogs which have been carefully trained for that
purpose;” and in like manner (<abbr title="Eusebius Præparatio evangelica, liber One page"><cite>Euseb.
præp. Evang.</cite>, l. I. p.</abbr> 11-12),
where he says: “Among the Hyrcanians and Caspians, some exposed persons
whilst yet alive to birds of prey and dogs; others only the deceased:
but the Bactrians exposed old people whilst yet alive to dogs.”
(See hereafter the <a href="#footnote_506">note</a> to <span class="sc">Gate 77</span>.)</p>

<p class="footnote">The Parsees believe that, immediately after death, the soul, like a feeble
new-born infant, flutters during the first day around the place where the
person died; on the second, around the Keshé, or place in the Dakhmé
where the body is deposited; and on the third around the Dakhmé or
Parsi burying-place; on the fourth, near the bridge of Chinavad, where he
is interrogated by Mithra and Rashné Rast, who also weigh his actions.
During the three first days, they celebrate the Surúsh Yasht, the Surúsh
Darún, the Patet Mokhtat (of souls), and the Surúsh Afergan. Patet signifies
a general confession of all sins a person may have committed.
Afergáns and Afrins are prayers in the form of thanksgivings accompanied
with supplications and benedictions. On the third night, at the
Gah Oshen, they celebrate four Daruns: the first in honor of Rashné Rast;
the second of Raon Ized; the third of Surúsh, with six Darúns, three
large and three small; and the fourth in honor of the Ferouers of the
Saints: with this last they place four dresses, along with fruits and cheese,
all of which are for the officiating priest.&mdash;<abbr title="David Shea">D. S.</abbr></p>

 The Niyayish is an humble and submissive form of prayer, of which
there are five, addressed to five Izeds, and containing their panegyrics:
the sun, Mithra, the moon, the female Ardouisur, and the fire Behrám.
Amongst the attributes of Ardouisur are: making females prolific, pure,
giving them happy child-births, supplying milk, etc. The great Vorôokeshé
makes every thing grow and exist in those places where it flows, and
whither it bears the element of water, from the source Ardouisur of a

 According to Hyde’s version Gojestah, or Gosakhtah, became the
devil, because he lapsed from the truth and lessened it. When he saw
he had to contend against the truth, he fell prostrate in astonishment
during a thousand years, and dared not venture to approach the world,
but remained groaning and trembling in his own place. I cannot find
this tradition in the <cite>Zend-Avesta</cite>, according to which, Bomasp is the
demon of falsehood. On the authority of <span class="sc">Gate 91</span>,
I prefer reading Gokhastah
to Kusastah, or “the broken.” Hyde (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 180) mentions that the

 According to an ancient custom which is observed even in our days,
the mouth of a dying Parsí is applied to that of a dog, who is to receive
the man’s last breath. This custom may have occasioned the belief that
the Persians let dogs devour their sick and dying. So says Herodotus
(<abbr title="liber Three">l. III.</abbr>); Strabo (<abbr title="liber Eleven">l. XI.</abbr>)
names the Bactrians and Sogdians as feeding for
this purpose certain dogs, whom they call “buriers of the dead;” Cicero
(<abbr title="Tusculanae, liber 45">Tusc., l. XLV</abbr>) mentions the
same of the Hyrcanians. Certainly, different
customs prevailed in different times among the numerous nations
who inhabited the vast empire of Persia: hence may be explained the
various and sometimes contradictory accounts of ancient authors whose
affirmation, denial, and silence, with respect to a particular fact, may
however, in many instances, with equal truth but with due restriction,
be applied to particular places and epochs.&mdash;<abbr title="Anthony Troyer">A. T.</abbr></p>

 The Parsis, from the most ancient to our times, neither bury nor burn
their dead, but expose them to be devoured by birds and wild beasts.
They fear to pollute the earth and the fire, which they hold sacred. It
is, however, well established that they built formerly very magnificent
sepulchres for kings and eminent men, to whom probably the privilege of
such monumental graves was confined.&mdash;<abbr title="Anthony Troyer">A. T.</abbr></p>

 If the epoch of Kaíomars be adopted according to Ferdusi, 3529
B. C., that of Zoroaster would be = 529 years before our era. In the
Mojmel al Tavarikh (<abbr title="Fourth">IVth</abbr> chapter, upon the chronology of the philosophers
and some kings of Rúm) it is stated that, since Zoroaster appeared,
1700 years had elapsed to the time of the author, who wrote in the year
1530 of the Hejira, or A. D. 1126; therefore Zoroaster would have lived
574 years B. C. If the 1700 years be taken for lunar years, the epoch
would answer to 522 before the Christian era.&mdash;<abbr title="Anthony Troyer">A. T.</abbr></p>

 Bahrám is the most active of the Izeds, the king of all the beings;
with a celestial body, receiving his glory and splendor from Ormuzd,
he presides over the 20th day of the month; he bestows health and victory,
and combats the Dívs. He appears under the form of a young man
of fifteen years, and under those of different animals; that of a cock has
already been mentioned (see <a href="#footnote_484">note</a>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 324);
he appears besides as a bull,

the planet Mars, and acts a great part in the ancient history of Persia.

 Nothing existed before the first principle began the work of creation;
this principle is called in the <cite>Bun-Dehesh Zaruam akarené</cite>, “the boundless
time;” that is, “sine extremitatibus anterioribus et posterioribus.”
Distinct from it is “the long time,” which is said to be created
by God, and not “self-existing” as the first. Among the productions
of this first principle, some are “self-creating,” such as Ormuzd and Ahriman
(see <a href="#footnote_403">note</a>, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 235-236);
others act only upon what exists already,
such as the three substances&mdash;the primordial light, the primordial water,
and the primordial fire. This is the doctrine expressed in Zand, Pehlvi,
and the most ancient Persian books. The above statement about the
eternal existence of the heavens seems therefore not in accordance with
it. The Abádians or the Kaiomarsiáns acknowledged the good principle
under the name of <span class="title">Yezdan</span>, and the bad principle under that of <span class="title">Ahriman</span>;
but they believed that the first only was from eternity, and not the last;
or in other terms, that light only was eternal and darkness created. The
cosmogony of this sect was the same as that related in the <cite>Bun-Dehesh</cite>,
or as that of Zoroaster; it is briefly as follows: The primordial bull was
the principle of all irrational creatures as well as of the human race.
According to the <cite>Izeshné</cite> and the <cite>Bun-Dehesh</cite>, the primitive man came
forth from the side of the bull; he was called in Zand <span class="title">gaya mereta</span>, and
in Pehlvi <span class="title">gayo mard</span>; a word compounded of <dfn>gaya</dfn>, “bull or life,” and
of <dfn>mĕrĕta</dfn>, “mortal,” or “man;” hence came <dfn>Gayomars</dfn>, or <dfn>Kaïomars</dfn>,
the name of a most ancient Persian king (see <a href="#footnote_250">note</a>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 29). From the seed
of Gayomard sprung a tree which was shaped like two men, and the fruit
of which comprised ten different species of men; from these two bodies
came the twins Meshia and Meshiané, man and woman, the ancestors of
mankind. Although created for happiness, they were seduced by Ahriman,
and averted from the adoration of Ormuzd; they wandered in the
wilderness, were addicted to hunting, clad in skins of animals, and their
posterity peopled the earth.</p>

<p class="footnote">But Ormuzd did not forsake his creatures. In order to emancipate
them from the rule of Ahriman, he destined to them his word, the law of
Zartusht, who always existed, but his <dfn>feruer</dfn>, that is, “the ideal of his
perfection,” was to be produced by Zardusht’s fire.</p>

<p class="footnote">He was to be preceded by <span class="title">Hom</span>, the first apostle of the law, whom Jemshid
followed. This king and prophet erected but few fire-temples;
mankind venerated the elements and the stars, not without a number of
evil genii, and a gross superstition began to prevail. For opposing this
and renewing the primitive law, Zardusht appeared.&mdash;<abbr title="Anthony Troyer">A. T.</abbr></p>

 According to the <cite>Boun Dehesh</cite> (<cite>Zend-Avesta</cite>, <abbr title="tome Two, pages">t. II. pp.</abbr> 347-348),
Ormuzd will during three thousand years move alone; during three other
thousand years, his operations will be blended with those of his adversary;
the subsequent three thousand years will belong to Ahriman; and
in the last three, completing the period of twelve thousand years, the
author of evil shall disappear; and at the resurrection of the dead and
the renewal of the bodies&mdash;previous to which event are to appear the three
posthumous sons of Zoroaster (see <a href="#footnote_433">note</a>, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 281-282)&mdash;the world shall
be without evil during all ages.</p>

<p class="footnote">The ultimate fate of Ahriman is stated in the <cite>Vendidad Sadé Izeshné</cite>

that impure being, who is a Div but in his thoughts; that dark king
of the Darwands, who understands nothing but evil; he shall, at the
resurrection, recite the Avesta, and not only himself practise the law
of Ormuzd, but establish it even in the habitations of the Darwands.”
Moreover it is said (<cite>Zend-Avesta</cite>, <abbr title="tome Two, pages">t. II. pp.</abbr> 415-416), that Ahriman, that
lying serpent, shall at the end of ages be purified by fire, as well as the
earth be freed from the dark abode of hell; Ormuzd and Ahriman, accompanied
by all the good and evil genii, shall sing the praises of the author
of all good.”&mdash;<abbr title="Anthony Troyer">A. T.</abbr></p>

 The author of the <cite>Dabistán</cite> names no other famous teachers or
sectaries of Magism, after the death of Zoroaster, besides Ardai Viraf,
Azarbád, and Mazdak: he treats of this last in particular in the subsequent
section, previously to which we cannot omit adverting to Mani or
Manes, whose name occurs in this book but once occasionally, as that of
a painter (see <a href="#footnote_377">note</a>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 205). He is however much more reputed as the
founder of a new doctrine, called from him <dfn>Manichæism</dfn>, which spread
its ramifications widely through the Christian world. According to
several authors, Mani was a Christian priest, and pretended to act the
part of Paraclet, the announced successor to Jesus Christ; according to
Khondemir, he endeavored to substitute himself for Mohammed, to
whom that prophecy respecting a Paraclet was applied by the Muselmans.
However it be, Mani’s Enghelion, or Gospel, has not been preserved,
nor any other work written by himself; the books of his followers
too, such as could be found, were burnt. His religion is stated to have
been a mixture of Magism, Brahmanism or Buddhism, Judaism, and
Christianism; Shahristani, often quoted in this work, and Mohammed Ibn
el Nedim el Werrak, author of the Fehrist (a history of literature), agree
in representing his doctrine as a branch of Magism with some Christianism
ingrafted upon it.</p>

<p class="footnote">The two points attributed to Mani by the commentator of the Desátir,
namely, the permission to kill harmless animals, and the prohibition of
sexual intercourse, belong rather to the ethical or practical, than to the
theological, part of his religion, which distinguished itself by particular
dogmas and opinions relative to the duality of principle, good and bad,
light and darkness, involving other metaphysical questions. These, we
know, were common to other religions in all times. Before Manes, Christian
sects combined the said principles with the dogmas of their religion:
so did the followers of Basilides, Marcion, Bardesanes, Valentius, and
others. These, as well as after them the disciples of Manes, happen to be
not seldom confounded with the Gnostics, which name was applied to different
sectaries, chiefly Neo-platonics, from the earliest to later times of
Christianism. The Manichæans rejected the Old Testament entirely, and
partly the New, which they interpreted according to their opinion. They
disputed about the nature of Jesus, and modified Christian theology; they
believed a region inhabited by God and the pure spirits, prior to the
creation; a world, created of an eternal and self-existing matter; ten
heavens and eight earths; two empires, the one of light and the other of
darkness; the last, ruled by the great Lord, called “matter;” demons
with material souls and bodies; the soul no part of the divinty, but united
with the body to govern it; two souls in every man; the propagation of
souls; a transmigration of souls into animals; the stars, and every thing
in nature, even the stones, animated; the rotundity of heaven and of
the earth; antipodes; and other theses too many to be all enumerated
in this place. They had besides particular rites of worship, from which
the veneration of the sun, the moon, and other stars, was not excluded;
they were averse to matrimony, and generally austere in their
manners. See about this extensive subject the <cite>Mémoires</cite> of the learned
Abbé Foucher, in the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr title="Histoire de l'Académie royale des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres">Hist.

<div class="chapter">
<p class="p4"><span class="sc">The fifteenth section gives an account of the
tenets held by the followers of Mazdak.</span>&mdash;Mazdak
<a name="Page_373" id="Page_373"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 373</span>
was a holy and learned man, contemporary with
king Kobad; his religion was extensively diffused,
but he was at last put to death by the illustrious
Nushirvan; his tenets were as follow: from the
commencement without beginning, the world had
two creators; the agent of good, <dfn>Yazdan</dfn>, “God,”
or “light;” and the agent of evil, <dfn>Ahriman</dfn>, or
“darkness.” The supreme God is the author of
good, and from him proceeds nothing but good;
consequently, intelligences, souls, heavens, and
stars are his creation, in all which Ahriman has no
share whatever; the elements and their combinations
<a name="Page_374" id="Page_374"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 374</span>
are, in like manner, the productions of the
Lord; the influence of fire imparts warmth to those
stricken with cold; the breathing of the winds gives
coolness and ease to those consumed by heat; the
water satisfies those parched with thirst; the earth
is the place of ambulation. In like manner, their
combinations, such as gold and silver among minerals;
the fruit-bearing trees among vegetables; the
ox, horse, sheep, and camel, of animals; the pious
and beneficent among mankind, are his creation: but
the consuming of animals by fire; the destruction of
living creatures by the sultry simoom (wind); the
foundering of ships in floods; the cutting bodies
asunder by iron, or their being pricked by thorns;
rapacious and noxious animals, such as lions, tigers,
scorpions, serpents, and the like, are all the works
of Ahriman; and as he has no share in the empyreal
heaven, they style it <span class="title">Behisht</span>; but as he possesses a
joint authority in the elemental world, opposition
has consequently arisen, and no form subsisting in
it is possessed of permanent duration. For example:
the Almighty bestows life, and Ahriman puts
to death; life is the creation of God, death that of
Ahriman; God produced health, Ahriman, pain and
disease; the Bestower of blessings created paradise,
Ahriman, hell; the worship of the Lord is therefore
most meet, as his kingdom is immense; and
Ahriman has no power, except in the elemental
<a name="Page_375" id="Page_375"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 375</span>
world; in the next place, the spirit of every one
devoted to God ascends on high, but that of Ahriman’s
servants abides in hell. Wisdom therefore
requires the man of intelligence to separate himself
from the Ahrimans; for although the author of evil
may afflict such a person, yet on being delivered
from the body, his soul ascends to Heaven, whither
Ahriman has not the power of coming.</p>

<p>In some parts of the <cite>Desnad</cite>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_524" id="fnanchor_524"></a><a href="#footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a></span>
Mazdak says:
“Existence arises from two principles or sources,
<dfn>Shíd</dfn> and <dfn>Tár</dfn>,” <span class="decoration">i. e.</span>: ‘light’ and ‘darkness,’ which
he afterwards interprets to mean God and Ahriman.
He afterwards says: “The works of light result
from choice, but those of darkness from accident;
light is endued with knowledge and sensation,
darkness is ignorant; the mixture of light and
darkness is accidental, and the disengagement of
light from darkness is also accidental, and not
the result of choice; whatever is good in this
world is an advantage emanating from light,
whilst evil and corruption arise from darkness;
when the parts of light are separated from darkness,
the compound becomes dissolved, which
means resurrection.” Again, he says in the same
volume: “There are three roots, or principles:
water, fire, and earth; when these are blended
<a name="Page_376" id="Page_376"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 376</span>
together, the tendency to good or evil arising from
their mixture is also accidental; whatever results
from their purest parts tends to good, and whatever
is derived from their grosser parts tends to
evil.” He says in the same volume: “God is seated
on a throne in the world, the source of all things,
just as kings are on the throne of sovereignty in the
lower world. In his presence are the four energies,
namely, <dfn>Bázkushá</dfn>, or ‘power of discrimination;’
<dfn>Yáddah</dfn>, or ‘power of memory;’ <dfn>Dáná</dfn>, or
‘faculty of comprehension;’ and <dfn>Surá</dfn>, or ‘gladness;’
in like manner as the affairs of royalty
turn on four persons: “the Supreme Pontiff,
the principal Hirbud, the commander in chief of
the forces, and the master of the revels. And
these four persons conduct the affairs of the world
through the agency of seven others, inferior to
them in rank, namely, chieftain, administrator,
<dfn>Banúr</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_525" id="fnanchor_525"></a><a href="#footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a></span>
<dfn>Dairván</dfn> (head of a monastery), agent,
<dfn>Dostúr</dfn>, and slave; which seven characters comprehend
under them the twelve <dfn>Rawání</dfn>, or ‘orbits’
of spirits, namely: the speaker, giver, taker,
bearer, eater, runner, grazer, slayer, smiter,
comer, goer, and abider. Whatever man unites
in himself the four energies, the seven agents,
<a name="Page_377" id="Page_377"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 377</span>
and the twelve qualities, becomes in this lower
world like a creator or protector, and is delivered
from all kinds of embarrassment.”</p>

<p>It is also stated in the same volume: “Whatever
is not according with the light and agrees with
darkness, becomes wrath, destruction, and discord.
And whereas almost all contentions among
mankind have been caused by riches and women,
it is therefore necessary to emancipate the female
sex and have wealth in common: he therefore
made all men partners in riches and women; just
as they are of fire, water, and grass,” In the same
volume we find: “It is a great injustice that one
man’s wife should be altogether beautiful, whilst
another’s is quite the contrary; it therefore becomes
imperative, on the score of justice and
true religion, for a good man to resign his lovely
wife for a short time to his neighbour, who has
one both evil and ugly; and also take to himself
for a short time his neighbour’s deformed consort.”</p>

<p>Mazdak has also said: “It is altogether reprehensible
and improper that one man should hold
a distinguished rank, and another remain poor
and destitute of resources: it is therefore incumbent
on the believer to divide his wealth with his
coreligionist; and so taught the religion of Zardusht,
that he should even send his wife to visit
<a name="Page_378" id="Page_378"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 378</span>
him, that he may not be deprived of female society.
But if his coreligionist should prove unable
to acquire wealth, or show proofs of extravagance,
infatuation, or insanity, he is to be confined
to the house, and measures adopted to provide
him with food, clothing, and all things requisite:
whoever assents not to these arrangements
is consequently a follower of Ahriman’s, and they
get contributions from him by compulsion.”</p>

<p><span class="person">Farhád</span>, <span class="person">Shíráb</span>,
and <span class="person">Ayin Hoshpúyár</span> adopted this
creed; besides these, <span class="person">Muhammed Kúlí</span> the Kurd,
<span class="person">Ismail Bég</span>, the Georgian, and <span class="person">Ahmadai of Tiran</span> (a
village near Ispahan) possessed this faith. From
them it has been ascertained, that the followers of
Mazdak do not at present assume the dress of Gebers,
but practise their religion secretly among the
Muhammedans. They also showed the author the
volume of Mazdak, called the <span class="title">Desnad</span>, written in old
Persian, which <span class="person">Ayin Shakib</span>, the grandfather of <span class="person">Ayin
Hosh</span>, translated into popular Persian. <span class="person">Farhod</span> was
a man of great intelligence, and assumed the name

Shirab went under the name of <span class="title">Shir Muhammed</span>, and
<span class="person">Ayin Hosh</span> under that of <span class="title">Muhammed Akil</span>; and as they

 This first chapter of the Dabistán, here finished, represents the Sabæismus,
or the worship of the heavenly bodies, and the formation of
society by a race of kings, called the Máhábádiáns, who were succeeded
by the Péshdádiáns, and other known dynasties of the Persian kings.
We see laid down the principal features of Asiatic monarchies which
have been preserved from times immemorial to our days. The Dabistán,
it is true, blends the ideas of more recent epochs with those of the
highest antiquity, and introduces sects of later times, the origin of
which he traces back to the times of Abád, Húshang, and Zohák. It is
however clear, that a very ancient religion prevailed in Asia, consisting
of two principal points: the first was the adoration of the Creator of
all good, whose unity was acknowledged very early by the enlightened
class of men; the second point was the detestation of the author of all
physical and moral evil. This religion inculcated purity of thoughts,
words, and actions, and a tender regard for animal life; not without a
great number of liturgical rites, dietetical observances, and other regulating
customs in private and public. We may comprise under the
general name of “Magismus” the fourteen religions mentioned in this
chapter, the last but one of which, namely, that of Zardusht, appears to
have been but a new systematic arrangement, not without a partial
reform, of the old general religion of Asia, which has also been attributed
to a more ancient Zardusht.</p>

<p class="footnote">The duality of principle (good and bad) seems to come home to the
common feeling of mankind; but it implies metaphysical questions
about the creation, anteriority, posteriority, derivation and duration of
light and darkness, about which the different sects are divided by their
dogmas and opinions. That of the Zardushtiáns derived from God light
and darkness, and considered the last as a shadow inseparable from the
body. Zardusht was a dualist, inasmuch as he adopted light and darkness,
as two eternal principles opposed to each other, and also inasmuch
as he taught two immediate authors of good and evil, who were independent
of, and absolutely contrary to, each other: but he was an unitarian,
inasmuch as he subordinated these authors to the eternal decrees
of the Supreme Being, who to him was the only principle of the universe,
with respect not only to its original creation, but also to all its
physical and moral accidents.</p>

<p class="footnote">Although subdivided into sects, Zardusht’s religion appears to have
been dominant, until the forcible introduction of Muhammedanism
among the Persians, and zealously supported by the preaching of four
wise men, called Sásán, who lived from 240 to 643 of the Christian era.</p>

<p class="footnote">Here follow the principal epochs of the Zardushtián religion from the
time of Gushtasp to the end of the ancient Persian monarchy:</p>

<h4 class="h4head">Transcriber's Note</h4>

<p>This book was written in a period when many words had not become
standardized in their spelling. Words and names have multiple spelling
variations, inconsistent hyphenation and inconsistent accent marks.
Misspelled words in English, Greek, Persian and Sanskrit were left
unchanged. Accent marks for transliterations of Persian and Sandskrit
were standardized with accents placed above vowels, and letter
s; a high comma precedes aspirated consonant h.</p>

<p>Duplicate words were removed. Obvious printing errors, such as upside
down, backwards, or missing letters, and letters in the wrong order,
were corrected. Spaces were added or removed between words, as
appropriate. Quotation marks and parentheses were adjusted to standard
usage. Missing stops were added to abbreviations and ends of
sentences. Missing commas were added between items in lists. Commas
were changed to stops at ends of sentences.</p>

<p>Footnotes were numbered sequentially and were moved to the end of the
section in which they occurred. Anchors for footnotes 69, 85, 192, 364,
479, 482, 489 are missing in the original; for 69, 85, 364, 482, 489,
anchors were added where they likely belong. Location for anchor 192
could not be determined. There are two anchors to footnotes 117, 138,
and 232. Tables within footnotes 251 and 253 were aligned to display
better in e-publications.</p>

<p>Noted, not changed:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>The word “ibid” occasionally is not in italics.</li>
  <li>For consistency, paragraph number <abbr title="Five">V.</abbr>, should be 5., page <a href="#Page_clxiv">clxiv</a></li>
  <li>The word “sir” is occasionally lower case as a title.</li>
  <li>Dots were used instead of ditto marks in footnote <a href="#footnote_499">499</a>.</li>
  <li>Page cite in footnote <a href="#footnote_105">105</a> should be 134, not 190, as printed.</li>
  <li>Page cite in footnote <a href="#footnote_460">460</a> should be 246, not 236, as printed. Link to correct citation provided.</li>
 </ul>

<p>Changes:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Removed extraneous comma between “latter formed” on page <a href="#Page_lii">lii</a>.</li>
  <li>Changed semicolon to full stop after “East India Company,” page <a href="#Page_clxxxix">clxxxix</a>.</li>
  <li>Changed colon to semicolon after the word “completed,” page <a href="#Page_20">20</a>.</li>
  <li>Changed colon to semicolon in the series of phrases in the quotation on page <a href="#Page_150">150</a>.</li>
  <li>Changed stop to to colon, third paragraph, <a href="#Page_196">196</a>.</li>
 </ul>
